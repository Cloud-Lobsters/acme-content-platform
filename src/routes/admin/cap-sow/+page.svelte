						<li><strong>Change Control:</strong> For this SOW, either party may propose a Change Request. The Sub-Contractor shall have not less than fifteen (15) Business Days to assess any Change Request.</li>
						<li><strong>Security Obligations:</strong> The obligations under Schedule 2 (Technical and Organisational Security Measures) shall apply only where the Sub-Contractor processes HSBC data on its own IT infrastructure.</li>
						<li><strong>Audit Rights:</strong> For this SOW, any audit shall be limited to once per year, on at least ten (10) Business Days' written notice, and confined to records directly relating to the services under this SOW.</li>
						<li><strong>Termination:</strong> If HSBC terminates the prime contract, this SOW shall automatically terminate with immediate effect, and the Sub-Contractor shall have no claim against Capgemini save for payment for Sub-Contract Work completed and accepted prior to termination.</li>
