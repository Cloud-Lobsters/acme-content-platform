		<strong>4.1</strong> Each party represents and warrants that it has the right, power and
		authority to enter into this Agreement and any Statement of Work and grant to the other party
		the rights (if any) contemplated in this Agreement and any Statement of Work.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>4.2</strong> The Sub-Contractor warrants that the staff supplied or engaged in the
		delivery of this Statement of Work shall not assert any claim for equal treatment against the
		Main Contractor under the Agency Worker Regulations 2010 or any other legislation. In the event
		of any such assertion or claim, the Sub-Contractor shall indemnify the Main Contractor on
		demand, for any claim or costs (including legal costs) incurred by, or awarded against the Main
		Contractor, in respect of any such claim or allegation.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>4.3</strong> The Sub-contractor warrants and undertakes to the Prime Contractor that all
		Staff providing the Services are employed directly by the Sub-contractor and that, in all cases,
		the Sub-contractor makes all payments to the Staff as employment income and deducts (and accounts
		to HMRC) for income tax and National Insurance Contributions through PAYE from all payments made
		to Staff.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>4.4</strong> The Sub-contractor shall indemnify, keep indemnified and hold harmless the
		Prime Contractor against all claims and losses arising out of or in connection with any breach
		of the obligations set out in Clause 4.3 above.

		<strong>Drafting note to be deleted:</strong> To be used only where we have an obligation to our
		customer not to use contractors within the supply chain. Such obligations are prevalent, for example,
		in the financial services sector. Note that in some customer contracts there may be a slightly
		lesser obligation (for example, not to use contractors who are outside IR35, which would allow
		our subcontractor to use contractors who are assessed as inside IR35). If this is the case and
		the contractor raises concerns about this drafting there may be an opportunity to negotiate an
		amendment to more closely reflect the obligations to our customer. Where clauses 4.3 and 4.4 are
		used, Clause 5.9 should be deleted.
