	title="Section 1: Definitions and Interpretation"
	reference="This section defines all the key terms used throughout the Framework Subcontract Agreement and establishes the rules for how the contract should be interpreted."
	summary="Section 1 is the contract's 'glossary'. It defines important terms like 'Main Contract' (the agreement between Capgemini and HSBC), 'Sub-Contract Work' (the specific work Cloud Lobsters will do), 'Deliverables' (what Cloud Lobsters must provide), 'Losses' (what damages could be claimed), and many others. The interpretation rules (1.2) explain how to read legal language in the contract - for example, that lists are not exhaustive and that references to laws include future amendments."
	risks={[
		"Broad definition of 'Losses' includes consequential damages, loss of profit, and reputational damage with no limits",
		"'Good Industry Practice' is subjective and could be interpreted more strictly by Capgemini/HSBC",
		"'Default' definition is very broad and includes acts of subcontractors Cloud Lobsters may not fully control",
		"'Affiliate' definition could bind Cloud Lobsters to obligations regarding related companies",
		"Automatic incorporation of future legislative changes (1.2.10) could increase compliance burdens",
		"Interpretation rules (1.2.8) make all lists non-exhaustive, allowing Capgemini to claim items not explicitly listed",
		"Order of precedence (1.3) puts Statement of Work first, allowing individual SOWs to override protections in main agreement"
	]}
	amendments={[
		{
			text: "Cap 'Losses' definition: Add 'subject to the limitations set out in Clause [Liability]' to prevent unlimited liability",
			clauseRef: "1.1"
		},
		{
			text: "Clarify 'Good Industry Practice': Add 'as practiced by companies of similar size and resources to Cloud Lobsters' to prevent unrealistic standards",
			clauseRef: "1.1"
		},
		{
			text: "Limit 'Default' to direct actions: Modify to exclude liability for subcontractors approved by Capgemini",
			clauseRef: "1.1"
		},
		{
			text: "Add materiality threshold: Insert 'In case of ambiguity, contract terms shall be construed against the drafter (contra proferentem rule)'",
			clauseRef: "1.2"
		},
		{
			text: "Protect against SOW override: Add to 1.3 'provided that no Statement of Work shall reduce Cloud Lobsters' protections or increase liabilities beyond those in the main Agreement without express written consent'",
