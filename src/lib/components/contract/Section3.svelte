		reasonable access to and use of existing facilities within any premises where relevant to its
		responsibilities under a Statement of Work and, such access is granted subject to Clause 3.3
		and any, rights, obligations or restrictions specified in the Main Contract; and
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>3.3</strong> The Sub-Contractor will ensure that its employees and subcontractors comply
		with such rules, regulations and practices whilst on premises which are under Customer and/or
		Main Contractor's control. In any case, the Sub-Contractor shall at all times be responsible

	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>3.4</strong> The Sub-Contractor shall achieve the Sub-Contract Work and each part of them
		by the corresponding date[s] set out in the relevant Statement of Work. If the Sub-Contractor
		fails to comply with the provisions of this Clause 3.4, due to its Default, then the Main
		Contractor may:
	</p>
	<div class="sub-clause">
		<p>
			<strong>3.4.1</strong> refuse to accept any subsequent attempts to perform the Sub-Contract
			Works (or part thereof) and terminate the Statement of Work immediately by written notice to

		Work and for 6 (six) months afterwards), without the Main Contractor's written consent, offer
		employment to any of the Main Contractor's personnel who have been engaged in any Sub-Contract
		in relation to a Statement of Work. However, this restriction shall not apply to any person who
		(without having been approached directly or indirectly) responds to a general recruitment advert
		placed by or on behalf of the new employer. If the Sub-Contractor breaches this Clause 3.5, the
		Sub-Contractor shall promptly pay to the Main Contractor a sum equal to the annual salary of the
		employee in question (net of benefits) and it is agreed that this amount is a genuine
		pre-estimate of the loss that the Main Contractor is likely to suffer as a result of such
		breach.
	</p>

	<p>
		<strong>3.6</strong> Notwithstanding, clause 3.5, the Sub-Contractor agrees that any restrictions
		in the Main Contract relating to the non-solicitation of personnel shall be construed as placing
		restrictions on the Sub-Contractor with regards to both the solicitation of the Customer's and
		the Main Contractor's personnel.
