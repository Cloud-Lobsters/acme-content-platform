		The Sub-Contractor must effect and maintain with a reputable insurance company policies of insurance
		which are the same as or equivalent to those policies which the Main Contractor is required to
		have in place under the terms of the Main Contract. Such policies must be maintained for the
		period specified in the Main Contract and the Sub-Contractor shall give to the Main Contractor,
		on request, copies of all such policies or a broker's verification of insurance to demonstrate
		that appropriate cover is in place, together with receipts or other evidence of payment of the
		latest premiums due under those policies.
