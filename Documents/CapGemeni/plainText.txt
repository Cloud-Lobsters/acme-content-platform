the Statement of Work; and
the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
Sub-Contractor’s obligations
3.1	During the Term, the Sub-Contractor shall:
perform the Sub-Contract Work (including the provision of Deliverables) in accordance with the terms of this Statement of Work, and the Main Contract so as to put the Main Contractor into a position in which the Main Contractor is able to fulfil all of its obligations to the Customer under the Main Contract in so far as the same relate to the Sub-Contract Work;
collaborate with, and act in accordance with the instructions of, the Main Contractor and the Customer where required by the Main Contractor (including co-operating and working with all other 3rd party service providers engaged by Main Contractor as part of providing its services to the Customer);
achieve the Sub-Contract Work and each part of them by the corresponding date(s) set out in the Statement of Work and in any event to enable the Main Contractor to have reasonable time to fulfil its obligations to the Customer;
co-operate with the Main Contractor and the Customer where required by the Main Contractor in all matters arising under this Agreement and any Statement of Work;
provide all information, documents, materials, data or other items necessary for the provision of the Sub-Contract Works to the Main Contractor in a timely manner;
inform the Main Contractor in a timely manner of any matters (including any health, safety or security requirements) which may affect the provision of the Sub-Contract Works; 
ensure that all tools, equipment, materials or other items used in the provision of the Sub-Contract Works are suitable for the performance of the same, in good condition and in good working order; 
provide, as required, sufficient numbers of staff of the suitable grade and calibre at all times to provide and maintain the Deliverables and Sub-Contract Work;
ensure that the Sub-Contract Work and Deliverables are provided by the Key Personnel. The Sub-Contractor may not change Key Personnel without the Main Contractor’s prior written consent and any replacement must be approved by the Main Contractor; 
provide the Sub-contract Works and Deliverables using all reasonable skill and care and in accordance with Good Industry Practice and Applicable Law; 
will ensure that Deliverables will be free from defects in design material and workmanship and will be of satisfactory quality including fit for purpose for any reason made known by Main Contractor to Sub-Contractor;
enter into any copyright agreement and/or confidentiality agreement if and when reasonably required by the Main Contractor or the Customer; and
obtain and maintain all necessary licences, permits and consents required to enable it to perform the Sub-Contract Work and otherwise comply with its obligations under the Statements of Work.
The Sub-Contractor’s employees, subcontractors and agents shall have reasonable access to and use of existing facilities within any premises where relevant to its responsibilities under a Statement of Work and, such access is granted subject to Clause 3.3 and any, rights, obligations or restrictions specified in the Main Contract; and
The Sub-Contractor will ensure that its employees and subcontractors comply with such rules, regulations and practices whilst on premises which are under Customer and/or Main Contractor’s control. In any case, the Sub-Contractor shall at all times be responsible for the actions of its personnel, the personnel of its sub-contractors and visitors while these personnel and visitors are at the premises and the said responsibility shall extend to all acts of such personnel while they are on any of the said premises whether or not such acts fall within the scope and course of their employment. 
The Sub-Contractor shall achieve the Sub-Contract Work and each part of them by the corresponding date[s] set out in the relevant Statement of Work. If the Sub-Contractor fails to comply with the provisions of this Clause 3.4, due to its Default, then the Main Contractor may:
refuse to accept any subsequent attempts to perform the Sub-Contract Works (or part thereof) and terminate the Statement of Work immediately by written notice to the Sub-Contractor;
procure work similar to the Sub-Contract Work from an alternative supplier; and
recover from the Sub-Contractor all Losses, damages, costs and expenses incurred by the Main Contractor arising from the Sub-Contractor’s default.
The Sub-Contractor shall not (during the term of the applicable Statement of Work and for 6 (six) months afterwards), without the Main Contractor’s written consent, offer employment to any of the Main Contractor’s personnel who have been engaged in any Sub-Contract in relation to a Statement of Work. However, this restriction shall not apply to any person who (without having been approached directly or indirectly) responds to a general recruitment advert placed by or on behalf of the new employer. If the Sub-Contractor breaches this Clause 3.5, the Sub-Contractor shall promptly pay to the Main Contractor a sum equal to the annual salary of the employee in question (net of benefits) and it is agreed that this amount is a genuine pre-estimate of the loss that the Main Contractor is likely to suffer as a result of such breach.
Notwithstanding, clause 3.5, the Sub-Contractor agrees that any restrictions in the Main Contract relating to the non-solicitation of personnel shall be construed as placing restrictions on the Sub-Contractor with regards to both the solicitation of the Customer’s and the Main Contractor’s personnel.
Warranties
Each party represents and warrants that it has the right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement and any Statement of Work and grant to the other party the rights (if any) contemplated in this Agreement and any Statement of Work.
The Sub-Contractor warrants that the staff supplied or engaged in the delivery of this Statement of Work shall not assert any claim for equal treatment against the Main Contractor under the Agency Worker Regulations 2010 or any other legislation.  In the event of any such assertion or claim, the Sub-Contractor shall indemnify the Main Contractor on demand, for any claim or costs (including legal costs) incurred by, or awarded against the Main Contractor, in respect of any such claim or allegation.
The Sub-contractor warrants and undertakes to the Prime Contractor that all Staff providing the Services are employed directly by the Sub-contractor and that, in all cases, the Sub-contractor makes all payments to the Staff as employment income and deducts (and accounts to HMRC) for income tax and National Insurance Contributions through PAYE from all payments made to Staff. 
The Sub-contractor shall indemnify, keep indemnified and hold harmless the Prime Contractor against all claims and losses arising out of or in connection with any breach of the obligations set out in Clause 4.3 above.
[Drafting note to be deleted: To be used only where we have an obligation to our customer not to use contractors within the supply chain.  Such obligations are prevalent, for example, in the financial services sector.  Note that in some customer contracts there may be a slightly lesser obligation (for example, not to use contractors who are outside IR35, which would allow our subcontractor to use contractors who are assessed as inside IR35).  If this is the case and the contractor raises concerns about this drafting there may be an opportunity to negotiate an amendment to more closely reflect the obligations to our customer. Where clauses 4.3 and 4.4 are used, Clause 5.9 should be deleted].
Price and payment
The Main Contractor shall pay to the Sub-Contractor the Price set out in the Statement of Work for the Sub-Contract Work in accordance with the timetable in the Statement of Work together with any applicable VAT. Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, the Subcontractor shall invoice the Price monthly in arrears. The Main Contractor shall make payment of undisputed and validly invoiced sums no later than 30 days after receipt of an invoice. Unless otherwise specified in the Statement of Work, the Prices are fixed and firm for the Term and are the only charges payable for the Sub-Contract Work, Deliverables and performance of all other obligations of the Sub-Contractor under the Statement of Work.
The Sub-Contractor shall comply with the Main Contractor’s purchase order mandatory policy, namely that Purchase Orders are only deemed valid if they include a Purchase Order number generated through GPS (“Purchase Order Number”).

https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Policy-Env-June-2022-update.pdf 
The Main Contractor may revise the Principles and/or Policy at any time by amending the website pages. The Sub-Contractor shall check www.capgemini.com from time to time to take notice of any changes that the Main Contractor has made.
The Sub-Contractor shall, and shall ensure that its subcontractors, suppliers and other third parties engaged in connection with a Statements of Work shall, at all times comply with the Principles and the Policy, and shall notify the Main Contractor as soon as possible in the event that the Sub-Contractor or its subcontractors, suppliers or third parties breach the Principles or Policy.
The Sub-Contractor shall review its compliance, and the compliance of its relevant subcontractors, suppliers and third parties, with the Principles and Policy periodically whilst continuing to provide any services or goods to the Main Contractor.
The Sub-Contractor shall, at no charge to the Main Contractor, promptly answer any questions or requests for information from the Main Contractor to enable the Main Contractor to assess the Sub-Contractor’s compliance with the Principles and Policy and/or promptly complete and return any surveys issued by the Main Contractor regarding the Principles and Policy.
The Sub-Contractor warrants that:
it has not been and is not engaged in any practices involving the use of child labour, forced labour, the exploitation of vulnerable people, or human trafficking (slavery and human trafficking);
its employees and agency workers are paid in compliance with all applicable employment laws and minimum wage requirements; and
it will take reasonable steps to prevent slavery and human trafficking in connection with the Sub-Contractor's business; and
it will comply with the Main Contractor’s Supplier Standards of Conduct currently available at https://www.capgemini.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Supplier-Standards-of-Conduct-_-English-version-_-26042024.pdf as updated from time to time by the Main Contractor.
The Sub-Contractor agrees to provide all reasonable information required by the Main Contractor for the purposes of completing the Main Contractor's annual anti-slavery and human trafficking statement as required by the UK's Modern Slavery Act 2015.
The Sub-Contractor will permit the Main Contractor and its third party representatives, on reasonable notice during normal business hours, but without notice if there are reasonable grounds to suspect an instance of slavery and human trafficking, to access and take copies of the Sub-Contractor's records and any other information held at the Sub-Contractor's premises and to meet with the Sub-Contractor's personnel and more generally to audit the Sub-Contractor's compliance with its obligations under this clause 15. The Sub-Contractor shall give all necessary assistance to the conduct of such audits during this Agreement and the Term of any Statements of Work.
The Sub-Contractor will adopt modern slavery provisions in its contracts with suppliers and subcontractors so as to ensure compliance with the Modern Slavery Act 2015.
Each party acknowledges that any breach by it of this Clause 15 shall constitute a material breach of the Agreement and any Statement of Work.
Audits and investigations
In addition to, and notwithstanding, any other rights of audit that Main Contractor has under this Agreement, the Sub-Contractor shall, for the purpose of assessing compliance by it (and/or its sub-contractors) obligations under this Agreement and / or any Statement of Work including ensuring accuracy of invoices, allow Main Contractor and /or its agents (subject to Main Contractor’s reasonable confidentiality terms) access to inspect and audit all information, records, accounts and other relevant information and premises (including allowing copying of documents) within Sub-Contractor’s possession or control including any Sub-Contractor equipment and materials stored on, or to be used at Main Contractor’s premises at all reasonable times during normal working hours except as stated in clause 16.2 and for a period of 18 months after termination or completion of performance of a Statement of Work. The Sub-Contractor shall provide Main Contractor and its agent with all reasonable cooperation, and assistance in respect of its obligation in this clause 16.1. 
Where such access, inspection or audit is required by an official government regulator, the Sub-Contractor shall allow such inspection or audit at any time and there shall be not be a limit to the number of such inspections or audits that can be undertaken.

The parties shall bear their own costs and expenses incurred in respect of an inspection carried out in accordance with clauses 16.1 and 16.2, unless the inspection identifies a material default by the Sub-Contractor, in which case the Sub-Contractor shall reimburse Main Contractor for all its reasonable costs incurred in the course of the audit/ inspection.
If an inspection identifies that Main Contractor has overpaid any part of the Price in a Statement of Work or any errors in the amount paid by Main Contractor, the Sub-Contractor shall refund to Main Contractor the amount overpaid (plus interest on such amount from the date of payment until the date of the refund) and rectify any errors within 14 days of notice to do so.
Main Contractor agrees it shall not have access to any other data belonging to Sub-Contractor's other customers. Furthermore, Main Contractor may, at its discretion, accept an independent audit report in lieu of performing an audit in the manner set out above.
Dispute resolution

If the matter is not resolved at this meeting the matter will be referred to the next level of the Sub-Contractor and the Main Contractor's management who must meet within two (2) weeks to attempt to resolve the matter.  If the matter is not resolved at that meeting the escalation continues with the same maximum time intervals up to two (2) more levels of management.  If the unresolved matter is having a serious effect on the Sub-Contract Work the parties will use reasonable endeavours to reduce the elapsed time in completing the process.  The Sub-Contractor may not initiate any legal action or purport to terminate this Agreement and/or a Statement of Work an until the process has been completed unless such party has reasonable cause to do so to avoid damage to its business or to protect or preserve any right of action it may have.
The levels of escalation shall be detailed in a Statement of Works:

If any of the above (as detailed in the Statement of Work) are unable to attend a meeting a substitute may attend provided that such substitute has at least the same seniority and is authorised to settle the unresolved matter.
If the dispute is not resolved by escalation in accordance with Clause 17.1, the parties will seek to resolve disputes between them by an Alternative Dispute Resolution technique recommended by the Centre for Effective Dispute Resolution. Neither party may initiate any legal action until the escalation in Clause 17 has been exhausted and either party has refused to submit to Alternative Dispute Resolution.
Where a dispute between the parties overlaps with a dispute between the Customer and the Main Contractor then notwithstanding the requirements of this Clause 17, the Sub-Contractor shall, at its own cost and at the request of the Main Contractor provide all reasonable assistance and information with regard to the resolution of such dispute and adhere to the dispute resolution procedures specified in the Main Contract.

Where Main Contractor issues a Change Request, the Sub-Contractor shall reply to Main Contractor within [X] business days of receipt, or such period as is otherwise agreed between the parties, either agreeing to the Change Request and providing details of work required; or refusing the Change Request and outlining the reasons for refusal.

The Main Contractor and the Sub-Contractor have entered into a governing agreement dated [date of Framework Agreement between Capgemini and the Sub-Contractor – XX] day of [October] 20[25] (“Agreement”); 
Pursuant to the Agreement the Sub-Contractor has agreed to perform certain services described in section 3.1 and/or Appendix C in connection with the Work to be carried out under the Main Contract.

Schedule
The Sub-Contractor will perform the Sub-Contract Work as described in the SOW commencing on the the start date of services, which is expected to be – 27th day of October 2025, but if the start date of the services is earlier than the date specified here, the SOW will commence on actual start date of the services. The Sub-Contract Work will continue until completed or until a date specified in the SOW. The Sub-Contractor agrees that no Sub-Contract Work will be delivered, or work performed prior to the commencement date or beyond the end date unless a change control notice is agreed upon by both Parties. 
Scope of Sub-Contract Work 
The Sub-Contractor shall perform the Sub-Contract Work as described in section 3.1 and/or Appendix C to the Main Contractor’s and/or Customer’s reasonable satisfaction.
Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria
The Sub-Contractor will have exclusive control over the means, method and details of fulfilling the Deliverables detailed in the SOW. The Sub-Contractor shall complete the following Deliverables to the Main Contractor’s and/or Customer’s reasonable satisfaction in accordance with the requirements of this SOW and the due dates and acceptance criteria specified below: 
DELIVERABLE NAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS – Provide a complete list of all quantifiable services/deliverables/outputs/specifications to be completed by the Sub-Contractor. Ensure that this is sufficiently detailed so that any 3rd party would be able understand exactly what is required. For example, if a report/presentation is required, please define what is expected from the report/presentation such as: format; length; level of detail; key outputs; key conclusions; etc.
Main Contract between Capgemini and our Customer may help to guide deliverables detail.
NOTE – Wording such as “assist”, “support”, “contribute to” is not appropriate to include in 	 Deliverables – suppliers must be fully accountable for delivery of all of their designated outputs.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA – Provide a full description of what would be classed as acceptable to Capgemini / our Customer. Will you be able to, without question, deliver Capgemini’s obligations to our Customer based on what has been delivered to you by the Sub-Contractor, and how will you judge that this is the case? For example, if completion of a piece of coding is required this code may need to successfully migrate into a test or live environment.
NOTE – “Accepted by Capgemini”, “Accepted by the Customer”, “Approved by PM” etc. is not acceptance criteria – please define the specific criteria against which Capgemini will judge successful delivery.
Acceptance Criteria from the Main Contract between Capgemini and our Customer may help to guide acceptance criteria.

Due Dates – For longer term services and/or services including multiple outputs, it is expected that Deliverables would likely be staggered throughout the term of the SOW with some Deliverables having dependencies on others. ie. we should not be in receipt of multiple Deliverables over a long-term SOW with all deliverable due dates on the last day of the SOW term.

Furthermore, Deliverables shall be of satisfactory quality within the meaning of the Sale of Goods Act 1979.
The Sub-Contractor shall perform all Sub-Contract Work to the standards agreed within the key performance indicators (KPIs) set out in the below table.
KPI Table – KPIs are critical and measurable factors against which successful performance can be evaluated. Please include any KPIs, tolerances and reporting dates in the below table. For complex, longer-term, multi-Deliverable SOWs it is expected that Sub-Contract Work will be monitored at regular intervals throughout the term in accordance with pre-determined KPIs to ensure clarity of performance measurement. If there are no KPIs, please remove the below table and the final sentence above. 


Payment
Payment to Sub-Contractor for performance of the Sub-Contract Work described in this SOW shall be made in line with completion of the Deliverables and milestones set out in section 3.1 and/or Appendix C, as detailed in the below table and/or Appendix E. 
PAYMENT – The payment dates set out in the table below should correspond with the Deliverables and Acceptance Criteria due dates set out in table 1 within section 3.1.
For longer term services and/or services including multiple outputs, it is expected that Deliverables would likely be staggered throughout the term of the SOW (with staggered payment dates) and some Deliverables having dependencies on others. ie. we should not be in receipt of multiple Deliverables over a long-term SOW with all deliverable due dates and payment dates on the last day of the SOW term.



Deviations from the Agreement
Any deviations from the Agreement can be found in Appendix B.
Additional Terms
Notwithstanding Clause 18 of the Agreement, the Sub-Contractor represents and warrants that (i) it has taken into account the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic and any potential consequences thereof when entering into this Agreement and (ii) the Coronavirus pandemic will not impact the Sub-Contractor’s ability to perform its obligations under the Agreement including providing the Services and / or the Deliverables/goods.  In this Agreement, “Coronavirus” shall be ascribed the meaning as set out in s1(1) of the Coronavirus Act 2020.
The Sub-Contractor agrees that the Main Contractor may on written notice to the Sub-Contractor suspend or terminate (without liability) in full or in part the Sub-Contractor’s right to perform the Sub-Contract Work and/or provide the Deliverables/goods if the Coronavirus pandemic or any consequences thereof impacts (i) the Customer’s ability to receive the Sub-Contract Work or (ii) the Main Contractor’s performance of the Contract.

SECTION II – OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES
Clause 8
Data protection safeguards
The data exporter warrants that it has used reasonable efforts to determine that the data importer is able, through the implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses. 
MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller
8.1	Purpose limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B. It may only process the personal data for another purpose: 
where it has obtained the data subject’s prior consent; 
where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or 
where necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
8.2	Transparency 
In order to enable data subjects to effectively exercise their rights pursuant to Clause 10, the data importer shall inform them, either directly or through the data exporter:
of its identity and contact details;
of the categories of personal data processed;
of the right to obtain a copy of these Clauses;
where it intends to onward transfer the personal data to any third party/ies, of the recipient or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information), the purpose of such onward transfer and the ground therefore pursuant to Clause 8.7.
Paragraph (a) shall not apply where the data subject already has the information, including when such information has already been provided by the data exporter, or providing the information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort for the data importer. In the latter case, the data importer shall, to the extent possible, make the information publicly available.
On request, the Parties shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by them, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the Parties may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.
Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.  
8.3	Accuracy and data minimisation
Each Party shall ensure that the personal data is accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. The data importer shall take every reasonable step to ensure that personal data that is inaccurate, having regard to the purpose(s) of processing, is erased or rectified without delay.
If one of the Parties becomes aware that the personal data it has transferred or received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the other Party without undue delay.
The data importer shall ensure that the personal data is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) of processing. 
8.4	Storage limitation
The data importer shall retain the personal data for no longer than necessary for the purpose(s) for which it is processed. It shall put in place appropriate technical or organisational measures to ensure compliance with this obligation, including erasure or anonymisation of the data and all back-ups at the end of the retention period.  
8.5	Security of processing
The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the personal data, including  protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access (hereinafter “personal data breach”). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. 
The Parties have agreed on the technical and organisational measures set out in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
The data importer shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the personal data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall without undue delay notify both the data exporter and the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13. Such notification shall contain i) a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), ii) its likely consequences, iii) the measures taken or proposed to address the breach, and iv) the details of a contact point from whom more information can be obtained. To the extent it is not possible for the data importer to provide all the information at the same time, it may do so in phases without undue further delay. 
In case of a personal data breach that is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data importer shall also notify without undue delay the data subjects concerned of the personal data breach and its nature, if necessary in cooperation with the data exporter, together with the information referred to in paragraph (e), points ii) to iv), unless the data importer has implemented measures to significantly reduce the risk to the rights or freedoms of natural persons, or notification would involve disproportionate efforts. In the latter case, the data importer shall instead issue a public communication or take a similar measure to inform the public of the personal data breach. 
The data importer shall document all relevant facts relating to the personal data breach, including its effects and any remedial action taken, and keep a record thereof.
8.6	Sensitive data
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions or offences (hereinafter “sensitive data”), the data importer shall apply specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards adapted to the specific nature of the data and the risks involved. This may include restricting the personnel permitted to access the personal data, additional security measures (such as pseudonymisation) and/or additional restrictions with respect to further disclosure.
8.7	Onward transfers
The data importer shall not disclose the personal data to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter “onward transfer”) unless the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module. Otherwise, an onward transfer by the data importer may only take place if: 
it is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer; 
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
the third party enters into a binding instrument with the data importer ensuring the same level of data protection as under these Clauses, and the data importer provides a copy of these safeguards to the data exporter;
it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings;
it is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; or
where none of the other conditions apply, the data importer has obtained the explicit consent of the data subject for an onward transfer in a specific situation, after having informed him/her of its purpose(s), the identity of the recipient and the possible risks of such transfer to him/her due to the lack of appropriate data protection safeguards. In this case, the data importer shall inform the data exporter and, at the request of the latter, shall transmit to it a copy of the information provided to the data subject.
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
8.8	Processing under the authority of the data importer
The data importer shall ensure that any person acting under its authority, including a processor, processes the data only on its instructions. 
8.9	Documentation and compliance
Each Party shall be able to demonstrate compliance with its obligations under these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation of the processing activities carried out under its responsibility.
The data importer shall make such documentation available to the competent supervisory authority on request.

MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor
Instructions
(a)	The data exporter has informed the data importer that it acts as processor under the instructions of its controller(s), which the data exporter shall make available to the data importer prior to processing. 
(b)	The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, and any additional documented instructions from the data exporter. Such additional instructions shall not conflict with the instructions from the controller. The controller or data exporter may give further documented instructions regarding the data processing throughout the duration of the contract.
The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions. Where the data importer is unable to follow the instructions from the controller, the data exporter shall immediately notify the controller.
The data exporter warrants that it has imposed the same data protection obligations on the data importer as set out in the contract or other legal act under Union or Member State law between the controller and the data exporter.
8.2	Purpose limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.B., unless on further instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter, or from the data exporter.
8.3	Transparency 
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties, available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the text of the Appendix prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data subject would otherwise not be able to understand its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted information.
8.4	Accuracy
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data exporter to rectify or erase the data.
8.5	Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data processed on behalf of the controller and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a). 
Security of processing
(a)	The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data (hereinafter “personal data breach”). In assessing the appropriate level of security, they shall take due account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subject. The Parties shall in particular consider having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data exporter or the controller. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security. 
(b)	The data importer shall grant access to the data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate statutory obligation of confidentiality.
In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify, without undue delay, the data exporter and, where appropriate and feasible, the controller after having become aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or proposed to address the data breach, including measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be provided without undue delay. 
(d)	The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify its controller so that the latter may in turn notify the competent supervisory authority and the affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data importer.
8.7	Sensitive data
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or a person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and offences (hereinafter “sensitive data”), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional safeguards set out in Annex I.B.
8.8	Onward transfers
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the controller, as communicated to the data importer by the data exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (in the same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter “onward transfer”) if the third party is or agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if: 
the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679;
the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person.
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in particular purpose limitation.
Documentation and compliance
(a)	The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter or the controller that relate to the processing under these Clauses. 
(b)	The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the controller.
(c)	The data importer shall make all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with the obligations set out in these Clauses available to the data exporter, which shall provide it to the controller.
(d)	The data importer shall allow for and contribute to audits by the data exporter of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-compliance. The same shall apply where the data exporter requests an audit on instructions of the controller. In deciding on an audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held by the data importer. 
(e)	Where the audit is carried out on the instructions of the controller, the data exporter shall make the results available to the controller.
(f)	The data exporter may choose to conduct the audit by itself or mandate an independent auditor. Audits may include inspections at the premises or physical facilities of the data importer and shall, where appropriate, be carried out with reasonable notice. 
The Parties shall make the information referred to in paragraphs (b) and (c), including the results of any audits, available to the competent supervisory authority on request
Clause 9
Use of sub-processors
MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor
OPTION 2: GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the controller’s general authorisation for the engagement of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list. The data importer shall specifically inform the controller in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement of sub-processors at least 30 days in advance, thereby giving the controller sufficient time to be able to object to such changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the controller with the information necessary to enable the controller to exercise its right to object. The data importer shall inform the data exporter of the engagement of the sub-processor(s). 
(b)	Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the controller), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data subjects. The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause 8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is subject pursuant to these Clauses.
(c)	The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter’s or controller’s request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any subsequent amendments. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.
(d)	The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract. 
(e)	The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby - in the event the data importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent - the data exporter shall have the right to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.

Clause 10
Data subject rights
MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller
The data importer, where relevant with the assistance of the data exporter, shall deal with any enquiries and requests it receives from a data subject relating to the processing of his/her personal data and the exercise of his/her rights under these Clauses without undue delay and at the latest within one month of the receipt of the enquiry or request. The data importer shall take appropriate measures to facilitate such enquiries, requests and the exercise of data subject rights. Any information provided to the data subject shall be in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.
In particular, upon request by the data subject the data importer shall, free of charge :
provide confirmation to the data subject as to whether personal data concerning him/her is being processed and, where this is the case, a copy of the data relating to him/her and the information in Annex I; if personal data has been or will be onward transferred, provide information on recipients or categories of recipients (as appropriate with a view to providing meaningful information) to which the personal data has been or will be onward transferred, the purpose of such onward transfers and their ground pursuant to Clause 8.7; and provide information on the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in accordance with Clause 12(c)(i); 
rectify inaccurate or incomplete data concerning the data subject; 
erase personal data concerning the data subject if such data is being or has been processed in violation of any of these Clauses ensuring third-party beneficiary rights, or if the data subject withdraws the consent on which the processing is based. 
Where the data importer processes the personal data for direct marketing purposes, it shall cease processing for such purposes if the data subject objects to it. 
The data importer shall not make a decision based solely on the automated processing of the personal data transferred (hereinafter “automated decision”), which would produce legal effects concerning the data subject or similarly significantly affect him / her, unless with the explicit consent of the data subject or if authorised to do so under the laws of the country of destination, provided that such laws lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject’s rights and legitimate interests. In this case, the data importer shall, where necessary in cooperation with the data exporter:
inform the data subject about the envisaged automated decision, the envisaged consequences and the logic involved; and
implement suitable safeguards, at least by enabling the data subject to contest the decision, express his/her point of view and obtain review by a human being. 
Where requests from a data subject are excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the data importer may either charge a reasonable fee taking into account the administrative costs of granting the request or refuse to act on the request.
The data importer may refuse a data subject’s request if such refusal is allowed under the laws of the country of destination and is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to protect one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
If the data importer intends to refuse a data subject’s request, it shall inform the data subject of the reasons for the refusal and the possibility of lodging a complaint with the competent supervisory authority and/or seeking judicial redress.

MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller
MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor
In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.   
Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the decision of the data subject to: 
lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work, or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;
refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.

The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.
Clause 13
Supervision
MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller
MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor
Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679:] The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory authority. 
The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions have been taken.


SECTION III – LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
Clause 14
Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses
MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller
MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor
The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities, prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.
The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the following elements:
the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer occurs; the storage location of the data transferred; 
the laws and practices of the third country of destination– including those requiring the disclosure of data to public authorities or authorising access by such authorities – relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer, and the applicable limitations and safeguards; 
any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the country of destination.
The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.
The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph (a). 
Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.  
Clause 15
Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities
MODULE ONE: Transfer controller to controller
MODULE THREE: Transfer processor to processor
15.1	Notification
The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary with the help of the data exporter) if it: 
receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal basis for the request and the response provided; or
becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all information available to the importer.
If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter. 
Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.). 
The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. 
Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.
15.2	Review of legality and data minimisation
The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data importer under Clause 14(e).
The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request. 
The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.
SECTION IV – FINAL PROVISIONS
Clause 16
Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination
The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever reason. 
In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under these Clauses, where:
the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of suspension; 
the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its obligations under these Clauses.
In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non-compliance. Where the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. 
Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for as long as required under that local law. 
Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation (EU) 2016/679.

Standard Data Protection Clauses to be issued by the Commissioner under S119A(1) Data Protection Act 2018
International Data Transfer Addendum to the EU Commission Standard Contractual Clauses
VERSION B1.0, in force 21 March 2022
This Addendum has been issued by the Information Commissioner for Parties making Restricted Transfers. The Information Commissioner considers that it provides Appropriate Safeguards for Restricted Transfers when it is entered into as a legally binding contract.
Part 1: Tables

Table 2: Selected SCCs, Modules and Selected Clauses

Table 4: Ending this Addendum when the Approved Addendum Changes

 Alternative Part 2 Mandatory Clauses:


￼ 	Where the data exporter is a processor subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 acting on behalf of a Union institution or body as controller, reliance on these Clauses when engaging another processor (sub-processing) not subject to Regulation (EU) 2016/679 also ensures compliance with Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295 of 21.11.2018, p. 39), to the extent these Clauses and the data protection obligations as set out in the contract or other legal act between the controller and the processor pursuant to Article 29(3) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 are aligned. This will in particular be the case where the controller and processor rely on the standard contractual clauses included in Decision […].￼ 	This requires rendering the data anonymous in such a way that the individual is no longer identifiable by anyone, in line with recital 26 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, and that this process is irreversible.￼ 	The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union's internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purpose of these Clauses.

￼ See Article 28(4) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 and, where the controller is an EU institution or body, Article 29(4) of Regulation (EU) 2018/1725.￼ 	The Agreement on the European Economic Area (EEA Agreement) provides for the extension of the European Union's internal market to the three EEA States Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The Union data protection legislation, including Regulation (EU) 2016/679, is covered by the EEA Agreement and has been incorporated into Annex XI thereto. Therefore, any disclosure by the data importer to a third party located in the EEA does not qualify as an onward transfer for the purposes of these Clauses.
￼ 	This requirement may be satisfied by the sub-processor acceding to these Clauses under the appropriate Module, in accordance with Clause 7.￼ 	That period may be extended by a maximum of two more months, to the extent necessary taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The data importer shall duly and promptly inform the data subject of any such extension. ￼ 	As regards the impact of such laws and practices on compliance with these Clauses, different elements may be considered as part of an overall assessment. Such elements may include relevant and documented practical experience with prior instances of requests for disclosure from public authorities, or the absence of such requests, covering a sufficiently representative time-frame. This refers in particular to internal records or other documentation, drawn up on a continuous basis in accordance with due diligence and certified at senior management level, provided that this information can be lawfully shared with third parties. Where this practical experience is relied upon to conclude that the data importer will not be prevented from complying with these Clauses, it needs to be supported by other relevant, objective elements, and it is for the Parties to consider carefully whether these elements together carry sufficient weight, in terms of their reliability and representativeness, to support this conclusion. In particular, the Parties have to take into account whether their practical experience is corroborated and not contradicted by publicly available or otherwise accessible, reliable information on the existence or absence of requests within the same sector and/or the application of the law in practice, such as case law and reports by independent oversight bodies.
