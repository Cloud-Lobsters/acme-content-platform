# CapGemini Framework Subcontract Agreement - Cloud Lobsters Assessment

**Date:** 2 October 2025
**Contract:** Framework Subcontract Agreement v8 August 2025
**Parties:** CapGemini UK PLC (Main Contractor) ↔ Cloud Lobsters (Sub-Contractor)
**Ultimate Customer:** HSBC

---

## Executive Summary

**RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT SIGN THIS CONTRACT AS-IS**

This contract is heavily weighted in CapGemini's favor and exposes Cloud Lobsters to significant financial and operational risks. Key issues include:

- **Rebate mechanism**: CapGemini takes 0.5%-8% of annual revenue (£50k-£80k on £1M contract)
- **Unlimited liabilities**: You bear uncapped indemnities while CapGemini's are capped
- **Unknown obligations**: You're bound by the HSBC Main Contract you haven't seen
- **Payment risk**: You only get paid if/when HSBC pays CapGemini

Your Appendix B counter-proposals address some issues but are **INCOMPLETE**. Additional protections are required before signing.

---

## Cloud Lobsters' Identified Concerns (TW1-TW11)

### TW1 & TW4: Flow-Down Obligations ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue:** Clause 3.1.1 binds you to undefined obligations from the HSBC Main Contract
**Risk:** Unlimited, unknown liabilities; could include onerous terms you never agreed to
**Status:** ❌ NOT ADDRESSED in Appendix B

### TW2: Payment Terms ⚠️ MAJOR
**Issue:** Ambiguity over "30 plus 30" days payment terms
**Risk:** 60-day payment delay; cash flow exposure if HSBC delays payment
**Status:** ✅ ADDRESSED in Appendix B (1 business day after CapGemini receives funds)

### TW3: Intellectual Property
**Issue:** Clause 8 - Need confirmation HSBC owns the code, not CapGemini
**Risk:** CapGemini could license your work back to HSBC for profit
**Status:** ✅ ADDRESSED in Appendix B (IP vests directly in HSBC)

### TW5: Liabilities & Indemnities ⚠️ CRITICAL
**Issue:** Clause 10 - Wide, uncapped indemnities in favor of CapGemini
**Risk:** Potentially unlimited liability; disproportionate risk allocation
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (liability capped at 125% but indemnities not explicitly addressed)

### TW6: Insurance ⚠️ MAJOR
**Issue:** Clause 12.1 - No details on CapGemini's insurance cover
**Risk:** Cannot assess if requirements are proportional; may require expensive coverage
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (acknowledgment of proportionality but no specific limits)

### TW7: Interest Rate
**Issue:** Clause 16.5 - No interest rate specified for overpayment recovery
**Risk:** Opens door to excessive interest charges
**Status:** ✅ ADDRESSED in Appendix B (BoE Base Rate - 2%, minimum 0%)

### TW8: Change Control ⚠️ MAJOR
**Issue:** Clause 19.1 - Heavily one-sided in CapGemini's favor
**Risk:** CapGemini can impose changes with little recourse; scope creep
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (15 business days to assess, but still one-sided)

### TW9: Notice Requirements
**Issue:** Clause 21 - Email notices not accepted
**Risk:** Forces slower, less practical communication methods
**Status:** ❌ NOT ADDRESSED in Appendix B

### TW10: ISO 27001 Certification
**Issue:** Schedule 2 - Requirement seems unnecessary when working on HSBC systems
**Risk:** Certification is expensive (£10k-£50k+ annually) and time-consuming
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIALLY ADDRESSED (limited to when processing data on own infrastructure)

### TW11: Rebate Mechanism ⚠️ CRITICAL - DEAL BREAKER
**Issue:** Schedule 3 - Unexpected 0.5%-8% rebate based on annual spend
**Risk:** CapGemini takes a cut of your revenue for simply passing work to you
**Impact:** On £1M annual revenue: £50k-£80k goes to CapGemini for doing nothing
**Status:** ✅ ADDRESSED in Appendix B (rebate mechanism removed)

---

## Most Problematic Contract Terms

### 1. Rebate Mechanism (Schedule 3) 🚫 DEAL BREAKER
**Annual Revenue** | **Rebate %** | **Amount Lost**
---|---|---
£0 - £500k | 0.5% | £0 - £2.5k
£500k - £1M | 2.0% | £10k - £20k
£1M - £2M | 5.0% | £50k - £100k
£2M+ | 8.0% | £160k+

**Analysis:** This is pure rent-seeking. CapGemini is taking money for being a middleman. This term alone makes the contract untenable.

### 2. Flow-Down Obligations (Clause 3.1.1) 🚫 DEAL BREAKER
```
"The Sub-Contractor shall comply with all obligations of the Main Contractor
under the Customer Contract that relate to the Services..."
```

**Problem:** You're bound by a contract you haven't seen
**Risk:** Unknown, unlimited obligations
**Example risks:**
- HSBC contract may include uncapped liabilities
- May require additional certifications or insurance
- May include restrictive non-compete clauses
- May have onerous audit rights or data retention requirements

### 3. Payment Risk (Clause 5.1) ⚠️ MAJOR ISSUE
**Current risk:**
- Payment only flows through after HSBC pays CapGemini
- If HSBC disputes deliverables, you don't get paid even if you performed correctly
- CapGemini bears no risk - pure pass-through
- Original terms: 30 days + another 30 days = 60 days to payment

**Appendix B mitigation:** Payment within 1 business day of CapGemini receiving funds

**Remaining risk:** Still dependent on HSBC payment; no protection if HSBC refuses to pay

### 4. Unlimited Indemnities (Clause 10) ⚠️ MAJOR ISSUE
**Your indemnities:** Potentially uncapped
- Data breaches
- IP infringement
- Third-party claims
- Regulatory violations

**CapGemini's liability:** Capped (typically at contract value or less)

**Result:** Catastrophic financial risk if things go wrong

### 5. One-Sided Change Control (Clause 19.1) ⚠️ MAJOR ISSUE
**Problem:** CapGemini can impose changes with minimal process
**Risk:** Scope creep, additional work without compensation, forced acceptance of unfavorable terms
**Appendix B improvement:** 15 business days to assess, but no right to refuse unreasonable changes

---

## Appendix B Counter-Proposals Assessment

### ✅ Effective Protections

| Term | Original Risk | Appendix B Solution | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payment Terms | 60 days, dependent on HSBC | 1 business day after CapGemini receives funds | **Good** - Major improvement |
| Rebate Mechanism | 0.5%-8% revenue loss | Removed entirely | **Excellent** - Essential protection |
| IP Ownership | CapGemini could claim rights | Vests directly in HSBC | **Good** - Prevents exploitation |
| Liability Cap | Unlimited exposure | 125% of charges | **Good** - Reasonable limit |
| Interest Rate | Unspecified | BoE Base - 2%, min 0% | **Good** - Fair and clear |

### ❌ Missing Protections

| Critical Gap | Risk | Required Action |
|---|---|---|
| **Flow-Down Obligations** | Bound by unseen HSBC contract | Add: "Sub-Contractor only bound by HSBC Main Contract terms disclosed in writing and agreed" |
| **Indemnity Caps** | Still potentially uncapped | Add: "All indemnities capped at 125% of contract value" |
| **ISO 27001 Carve-Out** | Expensive certification | Strengthen: "Not required when working exclusively on HSBC infrastructure" |
| **Change Control Rights** | Still one-sided | Add: "CapGemini cannot unilaterally impose changes; mutual agreement required for material changes" |
| **Email Notices** | Impractical communication | Add: "Email to designated addresses constitutes valid notice" |
| **Insurance Limits** | Vague proportionality | Add: "Insurance capped at industry standard (£2M-£5M professional indemnity)" |

## Financial Impact Analysis

### Scenario: £1M Annual Contract

**Under Original Terms:**
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Rebate to CapGemini | -£50,000 (5%) |
| Payment delay (60 days) | -£8,219 (interest cost @ 5%) |
| ISO 27001 certification | -£25,000 |
| Additional insurance | -£15,000 |
| **Total additional costs** | **-£98,219** |
| **Effective margin reduction** | **9.8%** |

**Under Appendix B Terms:**
| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| Rebate to CapGemini | £0 (removed) |
| Payment delay (1 day) | -£137 (minimal) |
| ISO 27001 (limited scope) | £0 (not required for HSBC infrastructure) |
| Additional insurance | -£15,000 (still unclear) |
| **Total additional costs** | **-£15,137** |
| **Effective margin reduction** | **1.5%** |

**Savings from Appendix B:** £83,082 (8.3% margin improvement)

### But what if things go wrong?

**Worst-case liability exposure:**

| Scenario | Original Contract | With Appendix B |
|---|---|---|
| Data breach claim | Unlimited | £1.25M |
| IP infringement | Unlimited | £1.25M |
| Regulatory fine (passed through) | Unlimited | £1.25M |
| Multiple simultaneous claims | Unlimited | £1.25M (aggregate) |

**Analysis:** Appendix B provides crucial downside protection, but gaps remain (especially flow-down obligations)

---

## Comparison with Industry Standards

### Payment Terms
- **Industry standard (back-to-back):** 7-14 days after prime contractor receives payment
- **Original contract:** 30 + 30 = 60 days
- **Appendix B:** 1 business day ✅ **Better than standard**

### Liability Caps
- **Industry standard:** 100%-200% of contract value
- **Original contract:** Unlimited ❌
- **Appendix B:** 125% ✅ **Meets standard**

### Rebate/Commission
- **Industry standard:** 0% (subcontractors not charged for work referrals)
- **Original contract:** 0.5%-8% ❌ **Highly unusual and unfair**
- **Appendix B:** 0% ✅ **Meets standard**

### Flow-Down Obligations
- **Industry standard:** Only specified, disclosed obligations flow down
- **Original contract:** All obligations, even undisclosed ❌
- **Appendix B:** Not addressed ❌ **Below standard**

### Change Control
- **Industry standard:** Mutual agreement required for material changes
- **Original contract:** Unilateral CapGemini control ❌
- **Appendix B:** 15 days to assess ⚠️ **Still below standard**

## Negotiation Strategy

### Your Leverage Points

**CapGemini needs you because:**
1. They've already committed to HSBC and need delivery capability
2. They're making margin on your work (rebate proves this)
3. Finding alternative suppliers is time-consuming and risky
4. HSBC likely doesn't know about the rebate mechanism

**You have alternatives:**
1. Direct contract with HSBC (eliminate the middleman)
2. Other subcontracting opportunities
3. Walk away if terms are unacceptable

### Negotiation Approach

**Phase 1: Open with Appendix B + Critical Additions**

Present this as your baseline position:
1. ✅ All Appendix B terms (non-negotiable)
2. ➕ Flow-down protection: "Only disclosed HSBC obligations apply"
3. ➕ Cap ALL indemnities at 125%
4. ➕ Strengthen ISO 27001 carve-out
5. ➕ Mutual change control for material changes
6. ➕ Email notices accepted

**Phase 2: If They Push Back**

Be prepared to:
- **Stand absolutely firm on rebate removal** - this is unconscionable
- **Demand to see HSBC Main Contract** - you can't agree to unknown terms
- **Accept 150% liability cap** if they insist (still reasonable)
- **Compromise on change control** - accept if you can refuse unreasonable changes

**Phase 3: Walk-Away Points**

**Do not sign if they refuse:**
1. Rebate removal
2. Flow-down obligations protection
3. Liability cap (at least 150%)
4. Access to HSBC Main Contract

**Why:** These terms could bankrupt you if things go wrong

### Suggested Communication

**Email to CapGemini:**

```
Subject: Framework Subcontract Agreement - Appendix B Counter-Proposals

Dear [CapGemini Contact],

Thank you for the Framework Subcontract Agreement. We've completed our legal
and commercial review and have identified several terms that create unacceptable
risk allocation for Cloud Lobsters.

We've prepared Appendix B counter-proposals that we believe create a fair,
balanced agreement. However, we need the following additional modifications:

CRITICAL (must-haves):
1. Flow-down obligations limited to disclosed HSBC Main Contract terms only
2. All indemnities capped at 125% of contract value
3. ISO 27001 not required when working exclusively on HSBC infrastructure
4. Mutual agreement required for material change control variations
5. Email notices accepted as valid

We believe these terms are reasonable and reflect industry standards for
subcontracting arrangements. The rebate mechanism in Schedule 3 is particularly
problematic - we cannot accept paying 0.5%-8% of revenue for work referrals.

We'd like to schedule a call to discuss these items. We're committed to
delivering excellent work for HSBC but need commercial terms that allow us
to do so sustainably.

We also request a copy of the HSBC Main Contract to understand the obligations
being flowed down to us.

Best regards,
Cloud Lobsters
```

## Specific Clause-by-Clause Recommendations

### Clause 3.1.1 - Flow-Down Obligations
**Current:** "The Sub-Contractor shall comply with all obligations of the Main Contractor under the Customer Contract..."

**Proposed amendment:**
```
"The Sub-Contractor shall comply with obligations of the Main Contractor under
the Customer Contract that:
(a) have been disclosed in writing to the Sub-Contractor;
(b) relate specifically to the Services being provided; and
(c) have been expressly agreed by the Sub-Contractor in writing.

For the avoidance of doubt, the Sub-Contractor is not bound by any terms of
the Customer Contract that have not been disclosed and agreed."
```

### Clause 5.1 - Payment Terms
**Current:** Payment within 30 days (or 30 + 30 days)

**Appendix B version:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE
```
"The Sub-Contractor shall be paid within one (1) Business Day of Capgemini
receiving cleared funds from HSBC in respect of the relevant Deliverables."
```

**Additional protection recommended:**
```
"If HSBC disputes payment and Capgemini determines the Sub-Contractor has
performed in accordance with this Agreement, Capgemini shall pay the
Sub-Contractor pending resolution of the dispute with HSBC."
```

### Clause 10 - Liability & Indemnities
**Current:** Uncapped indemnities

**Proposed amendment:**
```
"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sub-Contractor's
aggregate liability under this Agreement, whether arising in contract, tort,
negligence, indemnity, or otherwise, shall not exceed one hundred and twenty-five
percent (125%) of the total Charges paid and payable under this Agreement.

This cap applies to all claims collectively, including but not limited to:
- Indemnities under clauses 10.1, 10.2, and 10.3
- Direct losses
- Consequential losses (except where expressly uncapped by law)
- Third-party claims"
```

### Clause 12.1 - Insurance
**Current:** Vague requirements

**Proposed amendment:**
```
"The Sub-Contractor shall maintain insurance cover proportionate to the Services,
including:
(a) Professional Indemnity: £2,000,000 per claim
(b) Public Liability: £2,000,000 per claim
(c) Employers Liability: £10,000,000 (statutory minimum)

The Sub-Contractor is not required to maintain insurance cover exceeding these
amounts unless the Services involve specific high-risk activities agreed in
writing."
```

### Clause 19.1 - Change Control
**Current:** Unilateral CapGemini control

**Proposed amendment:**
```
"Either party may request changes to the Services via written Change Request.

For material changes (>10% cost/time impact or fundamental scope change):
- Requesting party submits detailed Change Request
- Receiving party has 15 Business Days to assess and respond
- Changes require mutual written agreement
- No party may unreasonably withhold agreement to necessary Customer-driven changes
- If parties cannot agree, matter escalates to senior management

For minor changes (<10% impact):
- Parties will act reasonably and in good faith
- Agreement not to be unreasonably withheld"
```

### Schedule 2 - ISO 27001 & Cyber Essentials
**Current:** Mandatory certification

**Proposed amendment:**
```
"ISO 27001 and Cyber Essentials Plus certification are required only if:
(a) Sub-Contractor processes HSBC data on its own infrastructure; or
(b) Sub-Contractor has administrative access to HSBC production systems; or
(c) HSBC specifically requires such certification in writing

When Sub-Contractor works exclusively on HSBC-provided infrastructure using
HSBC-managed devices, these certifications are not required."
```

### Schedule 3 - Rebates
**Current:** 0.5% - 8% rebate mechanism

**Appendix B version:** ✅ ACCEPTABLE
```
"The rebate mechanism in Schedule 3 of the MSA shall not apply to this SOW,
nor shall revenues under this SOW count towards any calculation of annual
revenues for rebate purposes."
```

## Questions to Ask CapGemini

### Before Signing

1. **HSBC Main Contract:**
   - "Please provide a copy of the HSBC Main Contract so we can understand the obligations being flowed down to us."
   - "Which specific clauses of the HSBC contract apply to our Services?"

2. **Rebate Justification:**
   - "Can you explain the commercial justification for the 0.5%-8% rebate mechanism?"
   - "Is HSBC aware that you're charging us a rebate on this work?"
   - "Are you applying a similar rebate to your internal delivery teams?"

3. **Insurance:**
   - "What insurance cover does CapGemini maintain for this contract?"
   - "What are the specific insurance requirements you consider proportionate for our scope of work?"

4. **Payment History:**
   - "What is HSBC's average payment time to CapGemini?"
   - "Have there been any payment disputes between HSBC and CapGemini in the past 12 months?"
   - "What happens if HSBC doesn't pay due to their own liquidity issues?"

5. **Change Control:**
   - "Can you provide examples of typical change requests from HSBC?"
   - "What is the average frequency and magnitude of changes?"
   - "How will you protect us from scope creep?"

6. **Termination History:**
   - "Have you terminated any sub-contractors on similar HSBC work?"
   - "What were the circumstances?"

### Red Flags to Watch For

**If they respond with:**
- ❌ "This is our standard contract, non-negotiable" → Walk away
- ❌ "We can't share the HSBC contract due to confidentiality" → Unacceptable (they can share relevant sections or get HSBC permission)
- ❌ "The rebate is industry standard" → Untrue, push back hard
- ❌ "Trust us on the flow-down obligations" → Absolutely not acceptable
- ⚠️ "We can agree to some changes but not others" → Prioritize your must-haves

**If they respond with:**
- ✅ "Let's discuss your concerns" → Good faith negotiation
- ✅ "Here's the relevant HSBC contract sections" → Transparency
- ✅ "We can remove the rebate for you" → Recognition of unfairness
- ✅ "Here's our proposed compromise" → Willingness to negotiate

---

## Alternative Strategies

### Option 1: Direct HSBC Contract (Best Outcome)
**Approach:** Ask CapGemini to introduce you directly to HSBC

**Pros:**
- Eliminate middleman margin (8% rebate)
- Direct relationship with customer
- Clear requirements and expectations
- Faster payment
- No flow-down ambiguity

**Cons:**
- CapGemini may refuse
- May damage CapGemini relationship
- HSBC may prefer single contractor

**Action:** Worth exploring, especially if CapGemini won't negotiate reasonably

### Option 2: Limited Scope Trial (Risk Mitigation)
**Approach:** Agree to contract but only for small pilot project (£50k-£100k)

**Pros:**
- Test the relationship
- Limit downside exposure
- Prove delivery capability
- Negotiate better terms for main contract

**Cons:**
- Still exposed to unfair terms
- May waste time if main contract doesn't materialize

**Action:** Reasonable if you can't get full term improvements

### Option 3: Walk Away (Last Resort)
**Approach:** Decline the contract if terms remain unacceptable

**Pros:**
- Protect company from catastrophic risk
- Preserve resources for better opportunities
- Send message that you won't accept unfair terms

**Cons:**
- Lose revenue opportunity
- May damage CapGemini relationship

**Action:** Don't be afraid to walk away - a bad contract is worse than no contract

## Conclusion

**Is this a good contract for Cloud Lobsters?**

**No.** The original contract is heavily weighted in CapGemini's favor and exposes you to significant financial and operational risks.

**Your instinct is correct: CapGemini is screwing you.**

The rebate mechanism alone (0.5%-8% of revenue) is unconscionable - they're taking money for simply passing work to you. Combined with unlimited indemnities, unknown flow-down obligations, and one-sided change control, this contract could be financially catastrophic.

**However, with the right amendments, it could become acceptable:**

1. ✅ Appendix B provides a strong foundation
2. ➕ Add the 6 critical missing protections (especially flow-down obligations and indemnity caps)
3. 🤝 Negotiate in good faith but stand firm on must-haves
4. 🚶‍♂️ Be prepared to walk away if they won't negotiate

**Bottom line:** Don't sign without:
- Rebate removal (✅ in Appendix B)
- Flow-down obligations protection (❌ missing)
- Indemnity caps (⚠️ partial in Appendix B)
- Sight of HSBC Main Contract (❌ missing)

The risk is too great. This contract, as written, could bankrupt Cloud Lobsters if anything goes wrong. Negotiate hard, get the protections you need, or walk away.
