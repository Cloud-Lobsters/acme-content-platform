Appendix B – Special Terms for HSBC Engagement
	To the extent of any inconsistency between Appendix A and this Appendix B, Appendix B shall prevail.
1. Payment Terms
Notwithstanding anything in the MSA, for this SOW, Capgemini shall pay Cloud Lobsters in respect of valid invoices within one (1) Business Day of Capgemini receiving cleared funds from HSBC in respect of the relevant Deliverables. For the avoidance of doubt, no additional 30-day or other extended payment period applies. Payment is expressly conditioned on Capgemini having received cleared funds from HSBC; if HSBC does not pay Capgemini in respect of the relevant Deliverables, Cloud Lobsters shall not be entitled to payment. Capgemini shall not unreasonably delay passing funds through and shall provide evidence of receipt of funds on request.
2. Rebates
The rebate mechanism in Schedule 3 of the MSA shall not apply to this SOW. In addition, all revenue and fees payable under this SOW shall be excluded from any calculation of annual spend, rebate thresholds, volume discounts, or other incentive schemes under the MSA or any other agreement between the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, rebates shall not apply to this Statement of Work and shall not be taken into account in any future rebate calculations under other Statements of Work.
3. Intellectual Property
3.1 All Foreground IP created by Cloud Lobsters under this SOW shall vest directly in HSBC on creation and the Sub-Contractor shall, at Capgemini’s and/or HSBC’s direction, execute such assignments and do such acts as are necessary to effect that vesting. Capgemini shall not obtain any right, title or interest in the Foreground IP other than a limited right to pass the Deliverables to HSBC for HSBC’s use (and only to the extent necessary to permit HSBC’s use).
3.2 Cloud Lobsters retains all right, title and interest in its Background IP. Where any Background IP is required for HSBC to use a Deliverable, Cloud Lobsters grants to HSBC a non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable licence to use that Background IP for HSBC’s own internal use of that Deliverable only; Capgemini shall not acquire any licence to Background IP except to the extent strictly necessary to perform its obligations to HSBC and only as a pass-through.
3.3 Open Source: Cloud Lobsters may incorporate standard open-source software components under widely used permissive licences (for example MIT, BSD, Apache 2.0) provided such components do not impose obligations that restrict HSBC’s use of the Deliverables. Cloud Lobsters shall notify Capgemini in writing of any open source components used prior to delivery. No warranty that Deliverables are free of all open source exists beyond the covenant above; Capgemini shall not treat lawful open source use as an IP breach.
3.4 Source Code / Background IP Escrow: Cloud Lobsters shall not be required to deliver source code for Background IP except where the absence of such delivery would reasonably prevent HSBC from using the Deliverable. Any delivery of Background IP source code shall be subject to an agreed escrow arrangement (reasonable commercial terms) that protects Cloud Lobsters’ Background IP and trade secrets; escrow terms shall be agreed prior to any delivery.
4. Liability & Indemnities
4.1 For this SOW, the Sub-Contractor’s aggregate liability for all claims arising under or in connection with this SOW shall be limited to one hundred and twenty-five percent (125%) of the Charges payable under this SOW. This cap applies on a per-SOW basis and shall not be aggregated across multiple SOWs. For the purposes of this cap, annual fees mean the total fees payable under this Statement of Work only.
4.2 Notwithstanding any provision of this SOW, neither Party shall be liable to the other for any loss of profits, loss of business, loss of revenue, loss of goodwill, or any indirect or consequential loss or damage, whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, save that this exclusion shall not apply to:
(a) any sums expressly payable under this SOW; or
(b) liability which cannot be excluded under applicable law.
4.3 All indemnities given by Cloud Lobsters under this SOW (including those incorporated from Appendix A) are subject to the cap in clause 4.1, except to the extent liability arises from fraud, wilful misconduct, death or personal injury caused by negligence, or liabilities that cannot be limited by applicable law.
4.4 The Parties acknowledge that Capgemini’s MSA liability provisions (including any figures set out therein) are superseded by this Appendix B to the extent of any inconsistency.
5. Change Control
5.1 Either Party may propose a Change Request for this SOW. Cloud Lobsters shall have not less than fifteen (15) Business Days from receipt of a Change Request to assess and respond in writing. No Change Request shall be binding unless agreed in writing and signed by authorised representatives of both parties. No Change Request shall be deemed accepted by default.
5.2 Acceptance Testing: Cloud Lobsters shall not be required to repeat Acceptance Tests more than twice for the same Deliverable. If, after two (2) reasonable retest cycles, Capgemini/HSBC continue to reject the Deliverable for reasons that are not due to gross negligence or wilful misconduct of Cloud Lobsters, Capgemini shall either: (a) accept the Deliverable subject to a reasonable price adjustment; or (b) reject the Deliverable and pay Cloud Lobsters for Services performed and Deliverables accepted to date, including any reasonable unwind costs. Cloud Lobsters’ obligations for rectification shall be reasonable in scope and limited to defects that materially affect the Deliverable’s fit for purpose.
6. Security Obligations
6.1 The obligations set out in Schedule 2 (Technical and Organisational Security Measures) and any security requirements in Appendix A shall apply to Cloud Lobsters only to the extent that Cloud Lobsters processes HSBC Data on Cloud Lobsters’ own IT infrastructure. Where Cloud Lobsters performs all activities solely on HSBC-provided equipment (including VMs, laptops, and network access) and does not copy or export HSBC Data to Cloud Lobsters infrastructure, the technical obligations in Schedule 2 shall not apply.
6.2 For this SOW, compliance with HSBC’s IT security requirements shall apply only insofar as the Supplier processes HSBC data on its own infrastructure. Where HSBC data is processed exclusively on HSBC-provided machines or VMs, these obligations shall not apply.
7. Audit Rights
For this SOW, any in-scope audit of Cloud Lobsters shall: (a) be limited to once per year (unless a regulator requires otherwise), (b) be preceded by at least ten (10) Business Days’ written notice, (c) be limited to records and facilities directly relating to the Services under this SOW, and (d) expire twelve (12) months after the termination of this SOW. Audits shall be during normal business hours, be conducted in a manner to minimise operational disruption and where possible be remote. Any regulatory audits required by law shall be notified to Cloud Lobsters promptly and Cloud Lobsters shall be given opportunity to reasonably participate in the audit process.
8. Termination
If HSBC terminates the prime contract, this SOW shall automatically terminate with immediate effect, and the Sub-Contractor shall have no claim against Capgemini save for payment for Sub-Contract Work completed and accepted prior to termination.
Time shall not be of the essence under this SOW unless expressly agreed for a particular Deliverable.
9. Insurance
Cloud Lobsters shall maintain professional indemnity, public liability and employer’s liability insurance at levels proportionate to the services under this SOW and consistent with SME industry practice. Specific minimum levels for this SOW are: (i) Professional Indemnity: not less than £1m; (ii) Public & Product Liability: not less than £1m; (iii) Employers Liability: £10m. Capgemini acknowledges that Cloud Lobsters cannot reasonably hold insurance limits equal to Capgemini’s corporate policies and accepts these levels for the purpose of this SOW. Cloud Lobsters shall, on request, provide certificates of insurance.
10. Personnel Replacement
10.1 Capgemini/HSBC may request replacement of personnel where there is good reason (including security concerns or professional competence), but Cloud Lobsters shall only be liable for replacement costs where the replacement is due to Cloud Lobsters’ fault. Where Capgemini or HSBC reject personnel other than for Cloud Lobsters’ fault, the Parties shall agree in good faith how replacement costs are apportioned. Cloud Lobsters shall provide reasonable notice of intended personnel changes and a suitable replacement.
10.2 Nothing in this SOW shall require Cloud Lobsters to change terms of employment, nor to be responsible for any liability arising from Capgemini’s or HSBC’s decisions to remove staff from the engagement unrelated to Cloud Lobsters’ performance.
11. Interest on Overpayments
For this SOW, Clause 16.5 of the MSA is amended such that interest on any overpayment shall accrue at a rate equal to the Bank of England Base Rate minus two percent (2%), floored at zero percent (0%), from the date of payment until the date of refund.
12. Flow-Down Obligations
Cloud Lobsters shall be bound only by those flow-down obligations from the Customer Main Contract that are expressly included in Appendix A as at the Effective Date. For the avoidance of doubt, no flow-down obligations that were not included in Appendix A as at the Effective Date shall apply to Cloud Lobsters unless agreed in writing by Cloud Lobsters after negotiation and, where applicable, Cloud Lobsters shall be entitled to an equitable price and timetable adjustment to implement any subsequently agreed obligation.
13. Miscellaneous
13.1 If any provision of this Appendix B is held to be invalid or unenforceable, that shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder.
13.2 This Appendix B constitutes the complete and final statement of the Parties in relation to the subject matter herein and supersedes any prior inconsistent representations, agreements or understandings in respect of the matters addressed in this Appendix B.
