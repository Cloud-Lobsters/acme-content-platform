I need to write a strategy paper like a future state architecture for content management and engagement. I need to be able to articulate that at present there are multiple CMSs across IWPB, IWPB UK, Hong Kong, and CIB for example. In IWPB we use AEM, in CIB they use Sitecore. This is fragmented and disjointed and not optimal. The next element I need to bring out is the workflow. Some people create content on Excel spreadsheets, some people need to use a vendor to create content. Once that content is created, they have to manually upload it into some form of publishing tool, whether that is AEM or Sitecore etc. Then the fragments are pieced together to create a campaign. Then the campaign is ready for distribution that goes into the messaging channel. Underpinning this is when a campaign is being decided upon, there needs to be a decision engine that articulates who the campaign is relevant for. So we need robust data in order to do this. Then when the campaign is created, the target population is layered on top of that and the messages are distributed to that population. Following on from there, we need to clearly articulate how we are going to enhance the engagement model. Currently it is a fire and forget which is not optimal and not commercially viable. We want to create an engagement model which follows up and follows through with our communication. For example, if a new credit card was launching, we would want to be able to understand the target audience. We would want to be able to give them advance warning that a credit card proposition or product was going to be made available in two weeks time. On the day of the credit card launch, we might want to send them a text message to let them know that following on from their email, we are letting them know that the credit card is now live. For example, the same customer might see an in-app notification when they next log into the mobile app saying that they had been pre-approved for a credit card and they could apply now. I need to tie this all into a strategy that will then set us up for going forward.
ChatGPT said:

Got it — what you’re describing is really a future state content and engagement architecture strategy: moving from a fragmented, manual and channel-siloed setup → to a unified, data-driven, orchestrated, engagement-focused ecosystem.

Here’s a structured draft you can adapt into a strategy paper (and later into slides if needed). I’ll break it into sections so it flows logically like a consulting-style strategy paper.

Future State Content Management & Engagement Strategy
1. Current State Challenges

Fragmented CMS Landscape

IWPB: Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)

CIB: Sitecore

IWPB UK & Hong Kong: variations, multiple point solutions
→ Result: inconsistent governance, duplicated costs, fragmented experience.

Manual & Inefficient Workflow

Content often authored in spreadsheets or external vendor platforms.

Manual uploads into CMSs (AEM, Sitecore, etc.).

Campaigns “stitched together” from fragments with limited reusability.

No single workflow from ideation → approval → distribution.

Limited Decisioning & Targeting

Audience selection is ad hoc.

Reliant on fragmented data sets, not consistently governed.

No robust decisioning engine to personalise or optimise messaging.

Weak Engagement Model (“Fire and Forget”)

Current campaigns are single-touch.

No structured follow-through across channels.

Limited ability to test, learn, and optimise engagement.

2. Vision & Future State

We will create a unified, intelligent content and engagement ecosystem that:

Consolidates content management into a consistent framework.

Enables seamless workflows from content creation to distribution.

Uses data-driven decisioning to target the right audiences.

Evolves from “fire and forget” to a multi-touch, contextual engagement model.

3. Future State Architecture (Conceptual)
a. Content Management & Workflow

Unified Content Hub: Standardised tooling (converging CMSs where feasible).

Workflow Automation: Content authored, approved, and published through a governed process, eliminating spreadsheets/manual uploads.

Reusable Fragments: Content designed once, re-used across channels (email, SMS, app, web).

b. Decisioning & Targeting

Decision Engine: Centralised orchestration layer (e.g. Pega Decision Hub, Adobe Decisioning, etc.) consuming clean data to define “next best action.”

Data Foundation: Single, governed data layer ensuring campaigns are driven by accurate, real-time insights.

Personalisation at Scale: Tailored messages delivered to micro-segments, not just broad populations.

c. Engagement Orchestration

Multi-Stage Campaign Journeys: Campaigns designed as journeys, not single touches.

Channel Coordination: Consistent messaging across email, SMS, app notifications, and web.

Closed-Loop Engagement: Responses tracked → feeding back into data → optimising next touch.

Example: Credit Card Launch

Pre-Launch Awareness: Email teaser 2 weeks prior.

Launch Day Activation: SMS reminder aligned to email.

In-App Conversion: Pre-approved offer presented in app.

Follow-Up Nurture: Additional reminder if not acted on within X days.

4. Strategic Benefits

Consistency & Efficiency: Fewer CMS platforms, reusable assets, automated workflow.

Agility: Faster campaign creation and reduced reliance on vendors.

Regulatory & Risk Control: Traceability across workflow, approvals, and content use.

Personalisation: Right message, right time, right channel.

Engagement ROI: Multi-touch engagement increases conversion and customer satisfaction.

5. Roadmap (Illustrative)

Phase 1 – Stabilise

Map CMS landscape and define consolidation approach.

Implement standardised workflow and approvals.

Phase 2 – Integrate

Stand up decision engine.

Connect data sources into a single governed foundation.

Introduce reusable content components.

Phase 3 – Optimise

Pilot multi-touch campaign journeys.

Roll out orchestration across key markets (UK, HK, IWPB, CIB).

Embed closed-loop feedback and optimisation.

6. Call to Action

We must move from a fragmented, manual, fire-and-forget model → to an orchestrated, intelligent engagement ecosystem that enables HSBC to scale, personalise, and continuously improve customer communication.

👉 Tracey, I can also sketch this into a single-page “future state architecture diagram” showing:

Left side: Current state fragmentation.

Centre: Unified workflow + decision engine.

Right side: Engagement loop with channels and customer feedback.

Would you like me to draft that diagram in a Visio/slide style so you can use it alongside this narrative?

You said:
I really like this, thank you. One of the things I also need to consider is AEM is obviously quite expensive and therefore for heavyweight markets like the UK, Hong Kong, etc. that makes sense. But for lighter weight markets like Taiwan, Indonesia we might need to actually create our own in-house CMS and content workflow. So I also need to layer that in. I see one slide being two sort of swim lanes. One, the top swim lane, is heavy markets with the AEM and that workflow. And then the bottom workflow being for light markets with internal CMS build.
ChatGPT said:

Perfect — you’ve nailed the distinction: “heavyweight markets” vs. “lightweight markets.”
That’s a very natural way to show scalability without a one-size-fits-all burden.

Here’s how I’d layer that into your strategy paper + slide flow:

Update to Future State Strategy
Platform Strategy by Market

Heavyweight Markets (UK, Hong Kong, etc.)

High volumes, complex regulatory environments, and demand for sophisticated content and engagement.

Solution: Leverage AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) as the enterprise-grade CMS.

Full integration into decisioning engine, advanced workflows, reusable components.

Premium capabilities justified by scale and complexity.

Lightweight Markets (Taiwan, Indonesia, etc.)

Lower content volumes, less complex requirements.

Solution: HSBC-developed in-house CMS + workflow.

Lighter footprint, lower cost, focused on simplicity and speed.

Still plugs into the decisioning engine and engagement orchestration, but at lower cost-to-serve.

Principles

Consistency of workflow (regardless of platform).

Shared governance, data, and decisioning.

Right-sized technology investment aligned to market scale.

Slide Concept: Two Swim Lanes

Title: Future State Content & Engagement – Dual-Track Approach

Swimlane 1 – Heavyweight Markets (Top)

Content Creation → AEM workflow (authoring, approval, publishing).

Decisioning Engine → Target audience defined.

Distribution → Multi-channel (Email, SMS, App, Web).

Engagement Loop → Follow-through comms, feedback captured.

Swimlane 2 – Lightweight Markets (Bottom)

Content Creation → HSBC in-house CMS (lighter, faster).

Decisioning Engine → Target audience defined (same shared layer).

Distribution → Multi-channel (same orchestration).

Engagement Loop → Same follow-through, just scaled appropriately.

👉 Visually, the two lanes converge into the shared components:

Decisioning & Data (centralised, common across all markets).

Engagement Orchestration (consistent customer experience globally).

Narrative to Accompany the Slide

“This dual-track approach allows us to right-size our investment. Heavyweight markets with high content and regulatory complexity continue on AEM. Lightweight markets adopt a simplified in-house CMS that’s integrated into the same decisioning and engagement fabric. This ensures consistency, governance, and personalisation across HSBC, while optimising cost efficiency.”

Would you like me to draft the actual two-swimlane diagram (Visio/PowerPoint style, with the converging shared layers) so you have it ready to drop into your pack?

You said:
Then the last piece of the presentation should be how we're actually going to move from idea to action. What would the transition plan look like? What would the setup plan look like, etc.? What would we need to do? What are the next steps? Importantly, we would have to pick a proof of concept. We would need to pick a small market to mobilize our internal CMS on, etc., so I need to articulate that.
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — that’s the natural close of the paper: transition & mobilisation plan.
It shows that you’re not just painting a vision, but you have a pragmatic path to get there.

Here’s how you can frame it:

Transition Plan – From Idea to Action
1. Mobilisation & Governance

Establish Programme Structure: Portfolio ownership, market representation, technical leads.

Define governance model: approvals, compliance, risk, security baked into workflows.

Secure funding for dual-track approach (AEM in heavy markets, HSBC CMS in light markets).

2. Proof of Concept (PoC)

Select a Lightweight Market (e.g., Taiwan or Indonesia).

Criteria: manageable size, lower complexity, good testing ground.

Objective: Build and validate HSBC in-house CMS + workflow.

Scope:

End-to-end campaign cycle (content creation → approval → distribution → engagement loop).

Integration into central decisioning engine.

Test multi-channel orchestration.

Success Measures: time-to-market reduction, cost savings vs. AEM, engagement uplift.

3. Heavy Market Stabilisation

Assess existing AEM deployments (UK, HK, etc.).

Standardise workflows and templates across these markets.

Reduce vendor reliance by training in-house content teams.

Create a “playbook” from heavy market maturity to inform lighter markets.

4. Integration Layer Build

Stand up the decisioning engine (centralised service, connected to data layer).

Define integration standards for both AEM and HSBC CMS.

Build APIs for publishing to channels (Email, SMS, App, Web).

5. Engagement Model Pilot

Design multi-touch campaign journey (e.g., credit card launch).

Pilot in one heavy market (UK) and one light market (PoC).

Capture feedback and optimise engagement orchestration.

6. Scale & Industrialise

Phase rollout by region/market.

Build reusable content library (fragments, templates).

Train business and tech teams in new workflows.

Embed closed-loop measurement into BAU (Business As Usual).

Next Steps (Executive-Level)

Approve Strategy & Funding for dual-track approach.

Select Proof of Concept Market (recommend Taiwan/Indonesia).

Set up Core Team – delivery lead, content lead, technical lead, market sponsor.

Mobilise PoC Build – 3–6 months to design, build, test, and validate HSBC CMS workflow.

Parallel Track – stabilise AEM in heavy markets (governance, workflow, templates).

Review PoC Results – refine, then scale to additional lightweight markets.

👉 On a slide, I’d show this as a phased journey timeline (maybe 3 horizons):

Phase 1: Mobilise & Prove (PoC + AEM stabilisation)

Phase 2: Integrate & Orchestrate (decisioning + workflow alignment)

Phase 3: Scale & Optimise (multi-market rollout, closed-loop engagement)

Would you like me to draft the transition plan as a single “roadmap slide” (with 3 phases on a timeline) so you can use it as the closing piece of your pack?

You said:
Can you pull all of this into a complete pack outline, please?
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely — here’s a complete pack outline that pulls together everything we’ve built so far into a clean, consulting-style flow. Think of this as the skeleton of your presentation. Each section can be one or two slides depending on depth, with the detail placed in appendices if needed.

If you’d like, I can now mock up the visuals (swim lanes, roadmap, architecture diagram) in slide style so you have them ready to drop into your deck.

Do you want me to create those diagrams for you in a PowerPoint-ready format?

You said:
Sorry, I should have said that the whole heavyweight and lightweight CMS option would be an interim step. Ultimately, the goal is to get the in-house CMS functioning just as well as the likes of an AEM, and therefore, strategically, the in-house CMS will be the final picture.
ChatGPT said:

Got it — thanks for clarifying. That changes the strategic story arc:

AEM is not the long-term destination, it’s a bridge for heavyweight markets while the in-house CMS matures.

The end-state vision is HSBC’s own enterprise-grade CMS, capable of handling both heavy and light markets.

Here’s how I’d reshape the pack outline to reflect that:

📑 Content Management & Engagement – Future State Strategy Pack (Revised)

Would you like me to sketch the interim → convergence roadmap diagram (timeline with three phases showing dual-track collapsing into one global CMS) so you can use it as the final storyline slide?

You said:
Yes
ChatGPT said:

Transition Roadmap: Interim Dual-Track → Global HSBC CMS

Unable to display visualization

Here’s the transition roadmap diagram showing:

Red line = Heavyweight markets (AEM track).

Blue line = Lightweight markets (HSBC CMS track).

Both converge in Phase 3 into a single HSBC CMS global platform.

Do you want me to also create a clean slide version with swim lanes + icons so you can drop it straight into your pack? 

You said:
I think somewhere we need to call out the fact that we need to do an inventory of all of the CMSs and importantly, an inventory of all of the current assets, like content assets that we have. As I said previously, we do not use AEM to its full potential. For example, we don't use headless, there is no video capability, so we're falling behind our competitors. I think it's really important we understand what we have today and what assets we need in the future to really future-proof this. I need to create a point on this in the pack.
ChatGPT said:

You’re absolutely right — without a baseline inventory of both CMS platforms and content assets, the strategy risks being built on assumptions. This is also a very executive-friendly point because it shows discipline and pragmatism before making investments.

Here’s how we can slot it into the pack:

📍 New Section: Baseline Assessment – Inventory & Capability Review
1. CMS Landscape Inventory

Catalogue all CMSs currently in use across markets (AEM, Sitecore, bespoke tools, vendor-managed solutions).

Document usage maturity (are markets using the full feature set or only partial capability?).

Identify overlaps, redundancies, and cost implications.

2. Content Asset Inventory

Audit current content assets:

Text, templates, images, video, microsites, fragments, reusable components.

Understand how assets are stored, tagged, reused, or duplicated across platforms.

Assess governance: versioning, approval workflows, localisation.

3. Capability Gaps

Current AEM usage is limited:

Headless delivery not used → reduces omnichannel efficiency.

No video capability → falling behind peers in rich content.

Low reuse of components → duplication, inefficiency.

Competitors are leveraging headless, dynamic video, and real-time personalisation → HSBC risks lagging.

4. Future-Proofing

Define future-state asset classes: reusable fragments, headless delivery content, video, personalisation assets.

Align CMS capability roadmap to these future-proof needs.

Ensure inventory → informs migration and build strategy (so we don’t replicate inefficiencies in new CMS).

👉 Where to place this in the pack:

I’d add it between the “Problem Statement” and the “Vision”.

That way you tell the story: “We are fragmented today → but before we fix it, we need to know exactly what we have and what we’re missing → then we move to vision.”

Would you like me to draft a slide layout for this inventory section (like a 2x2 grid: CMS Inventory | Content Asset Inventory | Capability Gaps | Future-Proofing) so it fits seamlessly into your pack?

You said:
Yes, thank you.
