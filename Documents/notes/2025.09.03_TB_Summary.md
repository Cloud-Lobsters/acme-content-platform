# TB Strategy Session Summary - 3rd September 2025

## Overview
This conversation documents TB's strategic planning session with AI to develop a future state architecture for content management and engagement across HSBC's global operations.

## Current State Challenges

### Fragmented CMS Landscape
- **IWPB (International Wealth and Personal Banking)**: Adobe Experience Manager (AEM)
- **CIB (Commercial & Institutional Banking)**: Sitecore
- **IWPB UK & Hong Kong**: Various point solutions
- **Result**: Inconsistent governance, duplicated costs, fragmented experience

### Manual & Inefficient Workflows
- Content often authored in Excel spreadsheets or via external vendors
- Manual uploads into various CMSs
- Campaigns "stitched together" from fragments with limited reusability
- No unified workflow from ideation → approval → distribution

### Limited Targeting & Engagement
- "Fire and forget" campaign model
- Ad hoc audience selection
- No structured follow-through across channels
- Limited ability to test, learn, and optimize

## Strategic Vision

### Future State Architecture
**Unified, intelligent content and engagement ecosystem that:**
- Consolidates CMS (Content Management System) into consistent framework
- Enables seamless workflows from creation to distribution
- Uses data-driven decisioning for audience targeting
- Evolves to multi-touch, contextual engagement model

## Platform Strategy - Dual Track Approach

### Interim Strategy
**Heavyweight Markets** (UK, Hong Kong, etc.)
- Continue with AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) for enterprise-grade capabilities
- Stabilize workflows, templates, reduce vendor reliance

**Lightweight Markets** (Taiwan, Indonesia, etc.)
- Deploy HSBC in-house CMS (Content Management System) for PoC (Proof of Concept)
- Lower cost, simpler use cases, faster deployment

### Long-term Vision
- HSBC in-house CMS (Content Management System) evolves to enterprise-grade
- Heavyweight markets migrate from AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) to HSBC CMS
- One global CMS → one workflow → one engagement engine

## Key Requirements Identified

### Baseline Assessment Needed
1. **CMS (Content Management System) Landscape Inventory**
   - Catalogue all current CMSs across markets
   - Document usage maturity and feature utilization
   - Identify overlaps, redundancies, cost implications

2. **Content Asset Inventory**
   - Audit current assets (text, templates, images, video, components)
   - Assess storage, tagging, reuse patterns
   - Review governance and approval workflows

3. **Capability Gaps**
   - AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) underutilized (no headless delivery, no video capability)
   - Falling behind competitors in rich content
   - Low component reuse leading to duplication

## Transition Roadmap

### Phase 1 - Stabilize & Prove (0-12 months)
- Governance and workflow standardization
- Select PoC (Proof of Concept) lightweight market for HSBC CMS
- Stabilize AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) for heavy markets

### Phase 2 - Integrate & Expand (12-24 months)
- Deploy decisioning engine across both tracks
- Multi-touch campaign pilots
- Extend HSBC CMS (Content Management System) to additional lightweight markets

### Phase 3 - Converge & Industrialize (24-36 months)
- HSBC CMS matures to enterprise-grade
- Heavyweight markets migrate from AEM (Adobe Experience Manager)
- One global CMS ecosystem

## Expected Benefits
- **Efficiency**: Fewer CMS (Content Management System) platforms, reusable assets
- **Cost Optimization**: Right-sized technology investment
- **Agility**: Faster campaign cycles, reduced vendor dependency  
- **Risk & Compliance**: Governed workflows, full traceability
- **ROI (Return on Investment)**: Personalized, multi-touch customer journeys

## Next Steps
1. Approve dual-track CMS (Content Management System) strategy
2. Select PoC (Proof of Concept) market (Taiwan/Indonesia recommended)
3. Mobilize core programme team
4. Secure funding for PoC and AEM (Adobe Experience Manager) stabilization
5. Conduct comprehensive inventory of current CMSs and content assets
6. Define future-state asset requirements for competitive positioning

## Strategic Context
This initiative addresses HSBC's need to rationalize messaging across the bank while moving from fragmented, manual processes to a unified, data-driven engagement platform capable of delivering personalized customer experiences at scale.
