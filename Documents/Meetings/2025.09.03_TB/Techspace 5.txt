Okay, they don't make any sense because this is sort of what I'm going to go over so I don't need to go over it
Yeah, it did, um, but for the benefit of Tara maybe
Okay, sure, of course
So I think what he's trying to say is
We need to
Stale how you
Constrautitially help he just be seated
Not just from the two very bespoke pieces of work that we have spoke about because that
After
So I'm not be afraid to hear I know that because my hair is minted up to bear with me
So what he's saying is
What is the future state architecture that we see as in you and I see as the problem that we can solve
And then obviously
The innovation banking FQDN scanning piece is totally separate to this piece. That's just our piece of work that
That we want you to do and that that will be done
It's the second piece on that statement to work
Where we've spoken by looking at this sort of break down of the content management problem and he's sort of saying yeah
But you can
I can't just trust these guys on the fact that they're going to come in do some discovery work
I said they're not going to do that so I'm trying to explain to him that that's not what you're going to do
And he's like well get them to write done
What the future state architecture looks like in their head and and
Then we take that to Catherine and say this is what they
This is the the FSA that they think they can
Tackle and the first step of that would be to do this piece of work which is on your statement to work and then she's going to go
Wow great good. Let's do that and then you come in and then we work three
That piece of work to inform the bigger picture
So I've already picked on good duck and share it with Tara and I can ping away you Tara as well
And what I think we need to do so when I was speaking to me yesterday it touched on
Three sort of lenses which was the content management
and
At the moment there is multiple solutions across edges be safe and eye to pv they have a
EM
NCIV they have psychor and
the UK
Which is similar to item and pv which is a
M and then in Hong Kong
They've got something completely different. They've got like a bespoke
Sort of thing that they're doing
In order to get into that sort of flow
There is content creation that's done
Outside of that by the individual like marketing teams like the digital teams
Like the product teams etc
And they they do everything really fragmented they do some of on spreadsheets
They do some of it with external vendors where we don't have the right asset
etc
So he's sort of drew I don't know if you shared the material yeah, but but I'm sure and they're like
It doesn't make any work in sense
So and the way forward to the start off here saying
Content creation or fragmented you've got excels then you've got multiple CMSs
Then you've got a bit in the middle which sort of creates your campaign then you've got your transmission layer
Which is where he's sort of putting like decisioning and how you do decisioning and how you determine what goes where and who gets what campaign
And then what channel it needs to go right on so does it go via SMN so in our pitch or does it go
via email for example
Then underpinning it you've got this this engagement module and the minute a lot of the messages that we send are far and forget
So we just chuck it out so we spent all this effort
Creating all this content manually and
fragmented and multiple CMSs and then we do decisioning and then we
Decide who gets it and then we decide what channel is best for them checking on the marketing preferences to make sure that I don't send you an SMS if you've picked
You don't receive the SMS there's all that's logic in here and then we just find forget it and there's no
Engagement model there's no it's not client engagement is just
raw messaging is just
Is there any A.B testing or anything like that so
Not really so that that's the whole thing that I think needs to be articulated and
Funny I just I'll show our messages in a second and
Trace please before we like John must see what I'm looking out here for we go down into this it's not a rabbit hole
Sort of a rabbit hole just one thought it came to mind
We we've sort of brushed across the first part the the first one which is you know the
AI validation piece because you said that's relatively well understood it's quite a discrete piece of work
Is there any advantage of advancing that so at least we get our pez clearance and we get our feet under the desk and sort of decouple the two
Yes, they why don't we
So because it sounds like Venkha and and then we're on the books and then we've got
Traction because we've done work and we weren't crap and it suddenly becomes a lot easier because I do understand his concern that
It's a bit what will he that's beyond it's the second one and it's a lot of goodwill and hopefully people behave nicely and maybe we don't
What do you think Duncan I think it's a great idea just do the the discrete piece to the discrete piece
Get us on the ground get to talking they see that we're not idiots and then we'll say well
Yeah, yeah
Time though, so we do need to do two things parallel
I think this is good idea let me explore getting on the tips for this one but in order to even get you
In the door for for this one
I think we need to do this piece of work and and all he's looking for is a couple of slides that articulate this strategy that
He's really struggling so
When we talk about like
The this whole MVP strategy development what he's like is okay
That's the break time off it
Show me what it looks like as a strategy and then this is the break time off here
We've gone in at this sort of tactical level rather than the strategic why would you do this in the first place level?
So I understand that but so
100% let's push that then if you think I can break it out
But what what he's really looking for is
That sort of let me show you a couple of decks so this is the whole point right so he's going on a
Cron so we're in that right set back
He's the CIO of I WTV
He doesn't want to solve this problem for I WV he wants to solve it for as he calls it in the firm
The bank and our
So he's going out to have all these conversations with UK Hong Kong I just need to be CIV and there's an
What is it you're fucking doing what are you doing and he's like well, you know I'm going to I'm going to do that
And so this is a problem that and he's like
I need some way of being able to articulate this in a really clear and concise and really in
What's the word and this is pithy punchy whatever you want to call this way soon
It's sort of like it's it's to get inside
Oh, I want to be part of this so like that's what he's missing
So he's pulled together this day
He might be my screen okay?
Yes, we have a study
He's pulled together say the future content right?
This is ultimately why I think he's looking for but he's looking for it and
The bit more context wrapped around it
I don't know he pulled together this exact stuff for him because um a lot of it's a
Waffle woolly and waffly what he's been for is the hard hitting
I think which is what I've sort of put together in chat to be tea
It just needs to go into some sort of like clear
Slide deck that helps bring this to life and it doesn't want loads of words he's not a word person
So this immediately turns him completely off he's like you know why isn't this a table?
Why isn't this show me all my CMS is so then I did see this in the park down here
Which is like
The Aziz picture C. I be shared item PV and it shows you all of the
And keep point I don't even know what these swimmelings are because again there's no like keys on the swimmelings know what they are
So there's all around like data enrichment identity solution data collection
No idea and
Orchestration asked that management decision a
Activation optimizing and workflow and so I think this is I think this
is an example or
This is not about content by the way
Sorry, just be clear. I think this is an example of
What we use for orchestration what we use for workflow what we use for always so I think what he's looking for if you
Tie it back to his whiteboard. I think he's looking for something similar to this
But specifically for content so when he looks at slides like this he goes there
But when he looks isn't our agent engineer so like when he looks at this he's like, oh, okay
I can quickly and he can start to join the dots and stuff
What we come from so I think when he's looking for something similar but for content
But recognizing that we haven't got into the specifics on
Who's got water and where et cetera? Because I said to me, yes, I can't pull that together because I don't know
What C. I be half through the as I don't and he's like just put what you do know and then we can sort of fill it in and
It pissing detail right at unlike all right because we certainly can't do that with our current access
We certainly can't do that with our current access like there's no way
I know that I can't do it either
It's a limit knowledge that I've got so I know that but I think what what we need to do is
It's
From an abstract level we can because we know there's we know there's a multiple CMSs
We know there's multiple workflows. We know people are doing things manually
We know there's some things that are you know so you can you can stitch it together
but very
Abstract rather than conceptual than the real meat on the bones and
Try it this it looks like this is like the as is and then when you flipped up here you can start to see
Where they're going to actually make a difference and I think this is
Don't focus on natural like words on this focus on the
Construct off it rather than the actual detail on here
So I think he's looking for something that says here's your landscape today
Really messy really fragmented really manual you know you've no engagement model you've no am I you've got no blah blah blah
Here's what it could look like tomorrow and you have
Two CMSs heavy weight and lightweight with the view that ultimately your lightweight should become
Your one CMS in the future once it's we trust it once we've you know spent time developing it and and enhancing it and and moving
Smaller markets are
Not so challenging pieces of content
Here's your joint at workflow that everyone can follow
Here's your engagement model and here's your MI
Is it and again it doesn't need to be like you need to do X it's it's more around
Building like the foundation layers to say you need engagement model you need MI you need to be able to you know
So it's more that's the concept rather than
It's a strategy rather than
Here's the actual blueprint what you need to do it's not
You have sight core and CMS of course we can make reference to those because we know we've got those but
Even if we didn't know that
It's moving from
Multiple CMSs fragmentic process is manual it manual to get into this and then really manual three out of it
No engagement model no MI etc. except so I think we need to sort of
That's what the sort of story, but I think I don't know Duncan what what
When I read the
Chaps of here I was like yeah, this is exactly what what we need to do and just try and see what else is there
It feels like is this slide deck here with a bit less words at the beginning
But for this thing so I was just wondering if we did one slide which was like current problem statement and other slide which is
End state like where we want to get to if you show it higher
That's bit let me send this to you that's basically what if that that and not shell is it
Because that's what
That's ultimately where my head got to yesterday when I was I was delayed at city and I just think we're
How would I strategically replay this to him and that's ultimately what I think it is but
Like for example this is very very focused on
This is very deep like
It's quite detailed
And I think that's fine to do but I think it's looking for like a bit more sort of like
It's not the what are you it's not the how are you gonna do it sort of like the the higher and the what it's like
What we need to do and and how to we do it and then I think this one here is the proposed target state and
See yeah and then presumably there's another slide which is sharing the journey between the two so we're going to start off with these small piece of work here and then assuming that
So exceeds we slowly build a thicker and thicker and
Move from the current state to the future state
Yeah, is it like five slides as I guess what I'm trying to ask or is it does you want it's not a big side deck it's like it's
Three to five slides good. Okay, you know, but I think
We can enter it and I'm quite happy for it. I'm quite happy to get you in front of him
With the sides as well and like I did say to him like listen because he's like get you guys to animate yeah, I know but like
What do you ask them to do? So yeah, it's a bit crazy. So he sounds mental like
He sounds like he doesn't know what he wants or he just got no he's got no clarity in his head
No, what he wants but he just finds it really difficult to
He's spaghetti head like I'll take you later. Yeah, yeah
I think that's what he's looking for I think that hey, what he's used to it's he's used to working with people
That he can just go
And then they shake it into something goes this what you mean and he goes well
I mean and like teams that and move and yes, that's the finish article and then he's if they sort of
They take you on that journey to get his thoughts clarified and he's quite used to that whereas I'm not
Cause all the minds see dios and see I was always like
This is what I need or this is a man like he's going after Monday if they doesn't have
Like this is why it's important because he's like well what do we do here and and you copy these slides
So you've got this
Yeah, go from the beginning
Oh my you full screen. Yeah, another
I mean you made that yeah next next five please if you remember that next
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
This is a good one because it's showing you where the content strategy and the creative
Impits are coming from GPWS and content marketing. She has content operations
You know, it's shows you the different pieces of the jigsaw as well
So this is like although we've made snippet and rosin rationalizing our blah blah blah
There's still loads of fragment fragment
Affirmative across different teams
Limiting the official it's all about it's all about
Why the fragmented processes is inefficient and and it's all like sorry
Let me let all that you finish taking all the slides and move back so that's the next slide
But do you even know which one is useful useful useless right?
Do you even know like the value of sending a message via each of these channel or how it's going to be received and the impact of it
You've got all the slides and then I can
Yep
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, don't smith him
That's just the
That's just the empathy
It does feel like the AB testing is a really it's a very good asset gap in the market here
It's a really good idea AB testing and back and other lyrics what?
Yes, I have
Yes, yes
Well the problem with maybe you don't even know what you're measuring like what you send your message and measuring the number of like
Morgas have been taken out or switches or wearing the pipe and also if you'd found that you'd find the messages
The emails are amazing
But your mortgage on boarding systems rubbish so we lose everyone in that
Jesus I mean we did something very similar with someone else where they
They basically had their security was too strong and then we were just losing everyone at the first security checkpoint because no one was
Repaired to do so we adjusted yeah
I don't know if he's or any not do yeah
Yeah, well just capture that
Yeah
Think I'm gonna run out of tokens, okay
Right, sorry, and let me see what they said actually on the evisement
Yeah, do you coupling it's okay?
We require the ability to AB test with clear working functionality and able to feedback and all time
Okay, let's increase my balance
Oh
They look I let's see how the best way to call it strategic consolidate and rule map
And he means like a strategic strategy and it and a bit of a
Rungal process one I'll get shared this one was he before actually
I think that was one because I recognize that from cover
So it's all about the fact at the minute the way the really plainly the way I look at it
Content and messaging are just too distinct
functions the content and the messaging it just needs to
Here's the content far out of the door here's the content far out of the door
We don't really want that in the future we want it to become more of a customer journey lead piece
That says what is the what is the need for this customer to be communicated to and then you sort of figure out how best to communicate and what what content resonates
And it's more personalized and it's more
Well, yes, you would say in our experience sending the mess to messes has never received anything positive
But emails always do or whatever
SMS is needed in certain journeys because of OTPs for example
So you you can't get rid of your own your SMS is because and you need them for security
So DSP is underpin by SMS is there's also regulatory
No, cool
And SMS is on like the point is
Larts and stuff so there's a use case for every
channel it's about how we
how we
Tap into that channel but it becomes discretionary you say you say for this customer never send a discretionary SMS
But for this customer always send discretionary SMS is because they respond really well to them
Whereas in app alerts they really don't respond well to so start dialing those down and
Uping their SMS content or whatever
So if each message you're sending out let's say has three possible channels which one should each customer get the only get one
I don't know if you can ever I don't know if you can get dying
Again, this is what I've seen from the guy in Hangs Island Bank
I have a chat with him this morning to see what they're doing and they have
So they've got a couple things so they're looking to automate their journeys from like business requirements in
Like and they're looking to go here. They're in the middle now
Some of it's very manual so someone's awesome
Even the futures to the automated what I find really interesting with him was they have this one dashboard the tells them
Like the top messages that they send the volume of messages that they send
Here's the the source system
It goes into they're they called their platform mdc and
Message delivery center and then they've got a decision
Engine and then these are the telecom providers that they send the
And messages to you can see email SMS
I don't know if it's very right clear on your screen
They've got like the volume and message sent on top five message and stuff at the minute
We don't have anything like that in HSBC
They've also got there. It's they've also got three the money their management portal. They've got like
How many messages are pending in the pipeline? How many been rejected or improved grass and how many been sent or field
Except and then you can go in and deal a bit more
jiggery pokeory on on these things as well so I think
The bank needs to move that way. This is just one hand sign which is a different part of the bank
and but they're saying like
We've done this
You know what are you doing sort of thing
um
But Tracy if the very very long term is that every single person in the bank
Sorry not per every customer in the bank has a profile
Which identifies almost a bit like a dungeon and dragons thing what tells you the skills of the person and it says this person really responds well
To SMS is such
But if you accept that
But that is it
We're diffously hard to get to because of the
Highway on board customers in the data that we've got and
The limitations we've got across sharing data across brand and
If you accept that can't be done within our lifetime it will be done
But it can definitely be done and not where it started to try and date it was called single view of customer SBC single view customer
but you rely on
You're onboarding you rely on your sin bin relationships you rely on your TF marker
You rely on all these very non newly added
And flags the way to create that picture so you might be able to do it for
New to bank but
But it's very it just becomes history so why was thinking was that it becomes iterative because it doesn't matter whether you they sin bin thing
Yes, it's important but if you ignore that for a second and just say if customers start
Responding or not responding to your messages then over time you just learn they said a learning loop of it
So I think I think definitely that's something that
In the future like a longer term view which you definitely be looking to build up this sort of
Client visibility engagement you know matrix that you know
Tracey responds to text messages, but she doesn't even open their emails
So like if I need to get in touch but
I think we need to
But I thought with the practical stuff and then look at the sort of futuristic stuff
But to me that is futuristic because I've been through it with you just not where so I know how difficult it is
No, I it's obviously going to be a lot easier
But it's like let's just take a bite of some that we can definitely control
Just want to sort of an optimal drop this club of course. It is the longer term
But just the thought is so if you look at how politicians look at
Voters they often divide the moment to like 16 categories
Yeah, yeah exactly so you know you got the young parents you got all these different old single
If you did that so rather than trying to individually but you just put the individuals in the 16 buckets
And then each bucket has a certain attribute behavior
That's definitely one not Westy we we live for the demographics like we look at our over
Greats population
Propagination you look at the
Student population we look at the youth population you've got those demographics that you
Bucket them in
And
important thing is you have to layer on top of that they're
Everything over eating their marketing preferences and their data privacy and the GDPR and all that's for us
So there's there's always lenses you need to look three
That rely on really good robust data and the data is always the best the lecture
But the suggestion is is the ones you've got that and then you start doing the loop and let's say you never respond to text messages
So you then get put in a bucket called greater email crap at text messages
Yeah, you see what to mean and then I get it. I can totally understand your the process and and to be honest
Single of your customer which I worked on for a little bit in that way and
They they they had this sort of like trajectory and this plan of how to use the
But the data
Never got the data and so the your data sits outside of us and did your platform the data
Says for the data and analytics team so then you have to supply them with your requirement
And so they need to get on their backlog and their back, but so you're not in control of your own destiny with that stuff
Which is really challenging now not Western obviously pushing it and they're they've set up a whole big work stream to do it
And they're going to do it over the next few years
But he just be serious so fucking far behind
They barely know the your customer care that's the other thing. They've never cared so
People say to me all the time. I don't care if they get a message we make money in tomorrow walk and you're like
But you're spending shit loads of money
So imagine if you actually like reduce your spend and actually increase your so like you do need to care about this stuff
And they're just like yeah, we need money anyway, so like they're not even in the right they're not even in the right headspace for that
sort of
Thought I think that's definitely if you were looking at the plan that's definitely over here
We're still at the start in block on this one with them
Fair enough
So this is most in marketing play
No, no, no, it's content and messaging
Marketing is just one work stream that uses content and messaging like digital use marketing and content messaging
This is about creating
But the feedback loop is any relevant for marketing you don't care if they read the message or not
If you're telling and they're pin like they I'm read it and I'll get all the
We do because then they need you as a bank so you want to vaguely say this person
Yeah, it's like customer
attrition and like retaining and so it's about
There's obviously a commercial a commercial element element to this of course. There is yes
Because we want to make money from people and we want to retain their custom etc
But the bigger thing is around is all the effort that we're putting in to creating this content is all the effort
Our understanding is all the effort around you know the transmission decisioning and I'm the channel selection
Is that actually paying off or not and
So yeah, yeah, you could look at as
ultimately it's commercial isn't it but
The bit that then cuts more interested in is that engagement the client engagement like this new area that
I don't even know if I want to anymore I'm just slides leading me alone all the steam of the yes
Technically roll and just do you crack on and get somebody else to do the whole client and the it's called clients
In it's called head of client engagement and customer messaging
So it's all around how to be so digital channels to engage and
Make people want to buy good us and I'm how do we know that it's a good experience that are they're having a good experience with us?
So yes, it is about marketing but it is more by
the engagement strategy engagement model and I'm how we have we know how people are feeling in that
Yeah, make sense I mean
Yeah
So should we
Make sense to you because I think I talk myself around
every single lip that I'm actually to start going I feel like that kid that's starting the front of the building is going
What are we doing?
Yesterday obviously I like
I can't even begin to tell you I'm sitting at room with him and I'm just sitting there going
What
So I'm so confused it didn't need because I'm not like yeah, I'm not getting what is meaning he's like you get it
And I'm like no
He's talking for me so let me just answer this as seconds
You know what you're doing
That's the first thing bought me every email just have the things you're at each
Throw smiley face meeting face unsight
So simple so people really hate any of our love any of them I just click on it
Most of you won't but it gives you a little bit of a headache
I mean this is the better minimum
I agree this is madness. They're just it's like some are standing out on the top of this building just chucking flies into the street and just
Who knows what happens? Listen to I know exactly what the solutions is for enemies
Don't get a bunch of clever people
You let them get on with it you motivate them and then you say go and do
Clever competent people a bit a bit of a bit of a
Leway and just let them loose in your organization come back and be like okay
This is the problems you know when they're problem is but you reckon we're going
Nothing out to be able to solve better right of four page slide. We've got pandra on the board
You can have a crack at it but based by their we need to do them they're the thought work first
So you've got your
You know this is the current problems statement. This is
This is where we could end up. This is how we could do it and the first step of how we could do it is signing off as buddy south
But they should definitely decouple the sounds two sounds
Yeah total sense we should just
To wish you I'm part of me so forget about the other bit
I think it's an up here in this bank
I think I wear we're getting into politics
I think it's fine. We're always gonna be in politics. It's interesting
But yeah, this is like
People are fighting back because you're eating their lunch
I'm not really good for normal
I don't think that's it. There's just the guy has a job which is just stop this happening and he has to be a rule
And if he's overruled he has to be done the right way
I think his politics in that sense
I don't think this guy can get a kick back from
In person or whatever
But what you probably need to do I don't think personally not can the AI think that would don't go very well
I think he will go badly
I think that's okay because we'll prove it's not our fault
Because I think we're just gonna hit red tape off the bat
That's okay
We're in we've got cleared
We people like working with us then we'll do okay
Then yeah and we'll probably be broken the principle we've broken the concept that you can't come in
We have come in so now there's no principle you know the precedent has been set
That's my suggestion
That's why I like decoupling
No I agree yeah we should definitely
I'd they're wasting what it's time on turn of ground
It's not turn of ground
It's not turn of ground they're worried you're gonna come in chew up half a million quits worth of resources
But I just been a dick and wandering around and knowing this stuff
Half a million quits worth of that sure it's not turning down turning balance sheet
I agree with you
But the guy has a job with literal job as the stop I'm not getting in
And he's gonna do it unless we
So I suggest we sit down after this call get chat to you please me run over it the research over lunch
And then
I was in the tent to 12 get the research to go over it sit down draft something up hand over to Panda look at the truth
It's the guy's pretty pictures. That's my takeaway from this
The idea banned PowerPoint because it makes bad decisions look good
That's exactly I think you just you go to a bunch of people who just think tank
If only and then they're just
Growing about the post it would be where is they're don't have their way with all to execute anything on and it's talking shop
And there's just a bunch of them like
Really one days
I think given where we are we do but I really like you should completely have fucking project on you a little bit
I know
Like this is just you tap here hopefully you're very soon apparently
Scott is pushing it
Unfortunately it's called utopia number of times you said it tell you begin to look you're like just
Like it's like fucking nice what I could someone else do otherwise Alex will sl it is risk
I mean down we jump off the top dunk them was already out with her
It's like yeah, but the utopia will come
It's a fish let's go right now just click
Oh, can you just pipe down with this one?
It's just
Anyway
She's so pitiful
I know there's utopia
Just not in this life don't come back but
Just the optics
She's got nice what do you call it
Green
Oh, it's a good building
Yeah, come on come on
Are you very nice?
There we go
Any of the functionality of this watch I do feel I think it is morning
It's deep in just that we pay tax on
Interest
You're now getting us dug out by on
Very interesting not net interest
I think I should be able to take all my interest costs and all my interest earnings net them out and then pay tax on difference
Don't my mortgage is this much my savings can be a bunch
I should be able to do this you're gripe with a current tax system you do not clearly understand
Depth and breadth of the capture of HMRC
Well the problem the question is do you have a problem with the amount of money being raised or do you have a problem with the way the money is raised?
