### Summary

Duncan Elliot, Alex, and Tara met with Tracey Bailey, who joined remotely, to discuss two main projects: a template conformance project requiring a system to assess 300-400 critical templates against business and regulatory requirements, and the development of a content management workflow for Innovation Bank to streamline marketing material dissemination. Duncan Elliot offered solutions for both, including an FTE for template analysis using a local LLM and a three-month fixed-price engagement for the content management workflow. Tracey Bailey requested a rough cost estimate for the content management workflow project to facilitate procurement, noting a 20-day onboarding period.

### Details

* **Meeting Attendees and Connectivity Issues** Duncan Elliot noted the presence of Alex, Tara, and themself in the room, while Tracey Bailey joined remotely from Canary Wharf, initially experiencing significant connectivity problems due to noise and an unstable internet connection ([00:00:00](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.brb22kbszrc2)). Tracey Bailey eventually found a quieter spot, improving the audio quality and allowing the discussion to proceed ([00:01:04](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.dcn3o8p5tx3g)).

* **Template Conformance Project** Tracey Bailey introduced a project concerning 300 to 400 critical templates within the bank that need to conform to business and regulatory requirements. The current team is unable to confirm if these templates meet the necessary standards, leading to a need for a system to assess their compliance ([00:00:00](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.brb22kbszrc2)). Duncan Elliot inquired about the format of these templates, with Tracey Bailey indicating they are likely standard Microsoft Office documents like PDFs and Word files, used for customer contact ([00:02:08](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.xrogxzz4c0f0)).

* **Automated Template Compliance and Output Buckets** Tracey Bailey explained that the templates need to be run through a logic-based system incorporating regulatory and business requirements, which will then categorize them into four buckets: fully compliant, compliant with business but not regulatory, compliant with regulatory but not business, or non-compliant with either. This automated process, described as "your magic" by Tracey Bailey, is intended to efficiently determine the compliance status of each template ([00:02:58](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.asjz0373o180)).

* **Innovation Bank Content Management Workflow** Tracey Bailey also outlined a second significant project, which involves developing a content management workflow for Innovation Bank, a part of Silicon Valley Bank acquired by HSBC. This initiative aims to streamline the process of disseminating marketing material to messaging platforms and customers ([00:02:58](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.asjz0373o180)). The goal is to create a bespoke, scalable system that reduces reliance on existing vendors like PEG and Adobe ([00:04:15](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.1pl2n8b28fjq)).

* **Pricing and Onboarding Discussions** Duncan Elliot asked to price the content management workflow project and suggested an in-person meeting with someone at Finsbury to better understand the scope ([00:04:15](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.1pl2n8b28fjq)). Tracey Bailey noted that onboarding for the project would take 20 days as per Manchester House's standard timeline, and while conversations could occur during this period, a rough price estimate was needed for the contract to avoid issues with procurement if the cost was too high. Tracey Bailey clarified that they were seeking a general cost estimate based on experience and team capacity rather than a precise figure ([00:05:17](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.744tz449hz1m)) ([00:06:50](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.si7wtdpk39ka)).

* **Solution Implementation and LLM Considerations** Duncan Elliot confirmed that they could provide a solution for the template analysis and the content management workflow, with the latter being a three-month fixed-price engagement ([00:11:01](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.y5zedm2u05wm)). For the template analysis, Duncan Elliot suggested an FTE dedicated to listing requirements and proposed using a local Large Language Model (LLM) due to compliance concerns with cloud-based LLMs ([00:08:22](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.2g358y4fmno)). Although the template data is publicly available and not sensitive, Duncan Elliot warned that running a powerful LLM locally would require significant, expensive hardware, possibly costing hundreds of thousands just for the hardware ([00:09:16](?tab=t.xrf0cmwfjgr3#heading=h.eudtvck8m27w)).

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] Tracey Bailey will find out how many pages are in the templates and provide an FTE to support the project.
