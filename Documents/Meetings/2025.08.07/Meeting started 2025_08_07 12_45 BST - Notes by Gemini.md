### 00:00:00

   
**Duncan Elliot:** that's better.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Okay.  
**Duncan Elliot:** All right, we've got you've got uh Alex, Tara, and myself in a room.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Oh, hi. Okay. Sorry. I literally popped down to grab some lunch at Canary Warf. So, it's currently really like really noisy, so I'll try and be quick. So, do you want me to start from the beginning?  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah, please take it from the top.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Okay. So, let's not recap a man's house. I think that's sort of understood. So you'll go you can go via you can go via your company via merchants house.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** All good. There's two asks. The first ask is there is a system in the bank that has around 3 400 templates. H they're quite critical templates. They need to conform to a number of business requirements and a number of regulatory requirements. The team that owns templates cannot confirm or deny if these templates conform to the business requirements or the regulatory requirements.  
   
 

### 00:01:04

   
**Tracey Bailey:** So we need to use out the system understand what the templates are regulatory requirements are and what the business requirement.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Uh, you're breaking up, Tracy.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Oh, is it still reverse?  
**Duncan Elliot:** You're breaking up. We can't You're break You're You're breaking You're breaking up.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Oh, okay. Okay.  
**Duncan Elliot:** We can't hear you.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Can you hear me?  
**Duncan Elliot:** You need a stable internet connection.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Can you hear? Yeah, I'm sitting in the shopping like lunch bit. Um, can you hear me?  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Do Do you want maybe to ring us back when you're uh back in HSBC?  
**Tracey Bailey:** Um, I've gotten I've got me saying, but is that any better?  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Okay, that's better now. Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Okay. So, I'll stay away from people.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Okay. Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** So, so there is there's two Yeah, more and more levels in one.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Good advice.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Um, so there's two asks. The first ask is that we um are able to work with the business to understand what the business requirements are for those documents and what the regulatory requirements are for those documents.  
   
 

### 00:02:08

   
**Tracey Bailey:** So in the system that has around three to 400 templates in it, they need to conform to a set of business requirements and regulatory requirements and the business cannot um confirm. Oh, have we lost again?  
**Duncan Elliot:** Can I No, no. Sorry. Can I ask uh what these templates are?  
**Tracey Bailey:** All right.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Like what format?  
**Tracey Bailey:** letters.  
**Duncan Elliot:** What?  
**Tracey Bailey:** I don't know. I don't know you know as much. This is all I know. So I haven't worked with this business. I don't know. I haven't had any further conversations with anybody. This is just Vanc come to me this morning and said I I actually want them to do two things for me in the initial sort of um consultancy phase and this is number one. I said oh this is new and he said yeah. So I I've got a contact and called Jana. So, I'm going to pick up with Janna today to find out a bit more, but all I know is that they they're likely to be in PDF, Word.  
   
 

### 00:02:58

   
**Tracey Bailey:** They're likely to be standard Microsoft Officey stuff. They're not going to be anything funky considering that they're, you know, they're used for contact, customer contact.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Mhm.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Um so we need to be able to um run these templates through some sort of logic that has got the inbuilt regulatory requirements and business requirements and then it'll spit it out into the four buckets that we spoke  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** about. So either they conform either they conform business requirements but not regulatory either they conform regulatory or not business or they don't conform at all. Um so we need to we need to yeah it's either business or um uh regulatory and so we need um to run these templates through some sort of logic you that's your magic.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Don't know.  
**Tracey Bailey:** So that's number one.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Um, and number two is what we spoke about with Venat yesterday, which is this whole content management workflow for Innovation Bank, which is part of that Silicon Valley Bank that HTC bought. Um, and they're um, you know, they have a problem with getting their marketing material out to um, the messaging platforms and ultimately to their customers quickly.  
   
 

### 00:04:15

   
**Tracey Bailey:** So the other part of the work is working with ads and the team in innovation banking to really understand their workflow. Um and at the moment you know they're they're using everything from cellar tape and you know blue safety sticker al together and creating a bespoke system for for them that then could be scaled to other parts or other use cases in the bank. Um, obviously there is an element of if they're ex if they're using PEG and Adobe as an existing vendor, we can leverage that. But ideally, as we spoke about yesterday, we want to try and veer away from needing to rely on PEG or Adobe.  
**Duncan Elliot:** All right. So, he wants to price that second part. Okay. It would be good to be able to go to in Finsbury.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Is she around in Finsbury? we go and see the white of her eyes and have a chat with her and just to understand what the scope is so that it'd be a lot easier for us to uh to to price it because originally what we were going to do is just to do that free of charge like pricing um clickth through prototype in order to be able to price it.  
   
 

### 00:05:17

   
**Tracey Bailey:** Well, well, this Yeah, this would Yeah, this would be the second bit.  
**Duncan Elliot:** But it if you ask me I say it from the get go.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah. So, this is it. So, it'll take 20 days for you to be on boarded. That's just the time frame that Manchester House had gave HBC as a standard on boarding timeline. You can have conversations in that 20 days. That's not a problem. But what I need to know for the contract is like if if you're going to come back and say it's like, you know, 1 billion pound because you want to buy dishes, then um well, I had an inkling  
**Duncan Elliot:** How did you know it was going to be that? Yeah, you saw him hitting that black dial last night.  
**Tracey Bailey:** because you're very expensive. You know, your tastes are very expensive. And so in in No, that's so s\*\*\*.  
**Duncan Elliot:** All right. Okay. So, let let me let me flip it on around it and said Tracy.  
   
 

### 00:06:02

   
**Duncan Elliot:** Not now. I was say not now, but why don't you go away and tell us what you think that number should be. If you if you're more comfortable that way, then we can do that.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Negotiating. I'm not going to do that.  
**Duncan Elliot:** I mean, I'm giving you the option to um you know best.  
**Tracey Bailey:** No, you tell you tell me and then I'll add my number on top of it and then we'll have a number and then we'll give that to Vena.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Okay, why don't we go away? What's the kick back again?  
**Tracey Bailey:** Exactly.  
**Duncan Elliot:** 15 10 15\. Yes, my record 90%.  
**Tracey Bailey:** I I know. I know I know roughly because he's told me roughly what he has to spend on this piece of work. So I know roughly what he's got to spend just it's very it's it's it's literally very very rough.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Okay. Yeah, given where we are. That's uh trace it.  
**Tracey Bailey:** So I can So basically this is then cast like are they going to charge us like a million bucks for this?  
   
 

### 00:06:50

   
**Tracey Bailey:** And I'm like I I don't know.  
**Duncan Elliot:** No, no, no.  
**Tracey Bailey:** And he's like well you need to find out because if it's if it's if it's a million bucks then it's a non-starter. So what's the point of on boarding them with Mansion's house? So what he doesn't want to do is go through the pain and breaking his back to get through Mansion's house, pissing off our procurement manager as we've sort of done anyway and but go through all that process and then you come around you come and say oh this is going to cost you this and then we go ah okay we don't have that we don't have that so it's very rough it's like how would you know  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Okay.  
**Tracey Bailey:** and using your experience and your knowledge and the number of people that you have in your team your day rate etc roughly give me a number and let me know and then I'll let you know, if it's if  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Yeah. Okay.  
**Tracey Bailey:** it's where he is. And if it's if it's way under, I'll tell you, you have room.  
   
 

### 00:07:35

   
**Tracey Bailey:** If it's way Yeah.  
**Duncan Elliot:** over.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Okay.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Let us come back to you with an idea and we'll we can then just as you say we have a we'll jump on a call then. Um, thank you.  
**Tracey Bailey:** So you you have a do you have a n like I can give you a bit more info like around so like you'll be working with innovation banking for around you know a month doing discovery work around what is there and and in parallel you can be building as well like but that we will dedicate some um uh innovation banking FTE to support this ex that goes without saying so that will they will be on the  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah, we do need that. Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** park they will they will explain their workflow they'll explain the tools that they're currently using the challenges that they currently facing, how they're currently doing it, etc. They will walk you through their process. They will show you, you'll be able to, you know, get your hands on it, see it, touch it, etc. And then your job will be actually can you come up with a solution um within that three that sort  
   
 

### 00:08:22

   
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** of three-month window starting hopefully from September because obviously it takes 20 days on board and then in parallel working on this really minor I don't think it's a massive thing this whole 3 400 templates as long as you  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** have the business knowledge to define what the business requirements are and what the regulatory requirements are then exactly Yeah.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. Well, that that's the thing like you can start straight away. You can come up with an FT whose job it is to write that list of all the requirements both business and regulatory. And if you give that to me, my only problem will be to find the GPUs so that we can host locally a LLM because I don't think you'd be able to use any of the big boys because they you need to have your own LLM to run it because for compliance reasons, I imagine your compliance would probably bulk at the prospect of like uh so that might be a problem, but we could talk if there is  
**Tracey Bailey:** Heat.  
   
 

### 00:09:16

   
**Tracey Bailey:** Okay.  
**Duncan Elliot:** somebody we could talk to about running proprietary data through an LLM who's done it before um then that person might be helpful well on prem right if you've  
**Tracey Bailey:** So why would you run that inside the HSBC infrastructure though? Why would you run it within in in HBC? Why do you need to run it locally?  
**Duncan Elliot:** got the the server to run uh like an LLM then that is bring fence there's not there's no access to the internet so they it's like there's no way that data could be leaked to anyone. Having said that though, the data being looked at is publicly available data. Is it publicly available? Yes, it Tracy, these are publicly available documents, aren't they?  
**Tracey Bailey:** Well, we're sending them to customers. So, yeah, there'll be there'll be no customer data on them.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. So they're not that sens.  
**Tracey Bailey:** There'll just be static D. There'll be there's no customer like store code numbers or anything like that on them. That'll just be a variable on these and then you run you run a template through your database and collect the customer data at the other side.  
   
 

### 00:10:17

   
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah.  
**Duncan Elliot:** It's just be aware that if you run a good model locally using local hardware that is expensive like you're talking a lot of money to run it because you need really powerful hardware. But if you just run it on the cloud, pardon, you're talking six figures, I imagine, to run to run pardon 350 just for the hardware, thousand just for the hardware.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Like 20 or like 50 like 20 pounds or 50, right? Okay.  
**Duncan Elliot:** Yeah. If you're going to run like Yeah.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Okay.  
**Duncan Elliot:** But think about this documentation is not But you could you could use that. question I want to chuck in as well is could you find out from when you speak to the woman how many let's assume it's PDFs just for now how many pages are we talking because volume will have an impact on this in aggregate is it 10,000 pages is it 300 pages I imagine it's somewhere in between but but we can we can certainly uh spin up an LLM and give it the rules and do some I  
   
 

### 00:11:01

   
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah. Yeah. I will. Yeah. Yeah.  
**Duncan Elliot:** mean the key to this will be like testing and it's been audit It's basically going to be an audit job where you just run it through and then make sure that the quality of the output and then you're  
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah.  
**Duncan Elliot:** going to hit like 90% 99 and then you say what's good enough at that point because the regulator will never find it.  
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah.  
**Duncan Elliot:** So the key here is the process after you've trained it and well trained it after you've configured your LLM. The key will be how do you ensure that the the output is correct and we can it's it's good it's pure audit work like it's just something um so yeah we can do that and then with the other  
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah. Okay.  
**Duncan Elliot:** one we can also price it we've got a a good I'm sure we can come up with something it's three month work fixed price no worries um what would be good is if we could get access to that person and just start doing a a walk through with her um is it the CEO of the  
**Tracey Bailey:** Yeah. Yeah. and and I as soon as soon as as soon as so send me your bios send me um roughly what you think and don't send it to me formally. Send me your bios formally. Let's have a chat when you land on a number. Let me hear what it is. And if it's in the ballpark, I'll say you're in the ballpark. If you're too low, I'll set tell you you're too low. And if you're too high, I'll say oh s\*\*\*. Okay. Right. We might need to think about it. Okay. Excellent. Take care. No problem. No worries.
