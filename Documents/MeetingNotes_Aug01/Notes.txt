0	9600	why they want to send the content out, who they want to send the content out, once they
9600	17440	make the decision they want to go in and like decide what is that, like they also are telling
17440	24240	me that like in Pega and other platforms like the marketing cloud, Salesforce marketing cloud,
24960	31440	they have this whole campaign life cycle management, it is more we're talking about
31440	39440	sales engagement or like the client engagement platforms, campaign platforms and we want to
39440	48880	just like go end to end, so in the new thing you are there but I just want you to give enough weightage
49760	59440	to the messaging as a delivery, the last step and the messaging
61600	69120	controls that we might have before delivering, when I say delivery, to send a message to the China
69680	76080	mobile we might use a different provider of this Poland and all right and that is then the last step,
77040	85760	maybe the email provider might be different than us, so that is one level, then the level before is
85760	94400	like what are we doing in the aggregated MDP, in the MDP or what all capabilities that we have in
94400	103680	MDP and then like the step before is AEM, where the templates are there and like the formatting
103760	114800	is there and then the step before is like Pega or like I think Decision Night, so what would be good
115680	129600	is, now go back to your topic, I want you to say the new team or new holistic thing, it is not
129600	137760	content hub, the content hub is like if people think that it is only warehousing of the content
137760	146960	we lose the plot again, I want, we need to think over for the weekend and see what is that we are
146960	154480	going to say, that will fit our puzzle
157520	163680	cleanly, yeah, I think like if you look at, let me share my screen,
165840	175840	so I think we're saying the same thing, this is not just about content, this is the end to end
175840	182560	servicing of, it's around, I think I've got your point, I think what you want me to demonstrate
182560	190000	or show on here is the flow of the work coming in, whatever you are doing has nothing to do
190000	201760	within this page, you will not need to own any of this, so what I want you to, there is already
202480	209840	people focused on the mobile, people focused on browser, people focused on
211040	218880	APIs, people focused on security, correct, and also edge and routing and all, what we are saying is
219600	228880	that on top of what the engineering frameworks that we have, you need to figure out how the content
228880	236480	will flow through these things, what thing, that's the bit, so yeah, so you spoke about
236480	246720	wanting to in-house our PEGA and Adobe capability and we spoke about content creation, content
246720	254560	like distribution and content retirement etc, so what's the exam question, let's take a step,
254560	262240	what is the exam question in regards to? The exam question is if we are going to create a new team
264160	269120	or an enhanced team, how is it going to complement
271920	279440	the rest of the value streams or the ownership that are there but cuts across?
280080	290400	Okay and will this new enhanced team need to in-house PEGA functionality and Adobe functionality?
291760	301760	I would not say that will be this team's responsibility, they can leverage whatever be the
302560	310160	the thing, like I think right, like I think we, that I'm just saying because number one
310160	316640	people are panicking, as soon as we say that like we will take out Adobe, I think I got like yesterday
316640	322480	three calls, like I think they don't want, like I think, so okay, so things have maybe moved on
322480	331600	since we spoke on Wednesday night, okay, so this is about how we leverage the capability that's
331600	341520	in PEGA and Adobe and how we distribute. But what we need to say doesn't matter,
342320	353200	like what we might have to say is we assume there is a CMS, assume there is a decision system,
354160	362880	but we assume there is a CRM, but like there is an entire end-to-end workflow
363680	370960	that takes the journey of content all the way from its inception to its delivery,
371680	379040	how are we going to tie them together as a journey and like some parts of it we will own,
379680	386800	some parts of it we will leverage, like for example, we will not be owning the Hawaii Lab.
389120	395680	No, no, no, and this proposal doesn't, this doesn't assume that we would own any
396960	405760	applications, this is assuming that we will leverage PEGA and Adobe or have the ability
405760	416880	to build in-house those modules that Adobe and PEGA provide to HSBC and deliver content
417680	424800	out into those channels. This is not saying that we are going to own mobile or browser
424800	432240	or any other platform, this is about when there is demand coming in from each of these areas,
432240	440160	so for accounts, if there was an onboarding email that needed to go out, making sure that we
440160	447760	have the ability to own the template, the content, be able to amend the content,
447760	451840	be able to decide where that goes and how it's going to be surfaced.
462400	467680	Oh, what slide can you see?
475280	477440	Oh, weird, hold on, let me re-share.
480720	487600	Yeah, this is not assuming that we will own any platforms, this is assuming that we understand
488320	494480	how the demand for content comes into digital platforms and then how we
496640	499200	own or leverage the content.
503680	509600	Yeah, so, no, no, I'm saying other slide last thing, can you?
509600	512640	Oh, right, right, right, yeah, yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah, I get you.
512640	518640	Oh, I don't know where it all is. I've got that many packs opening.
519440	522320	Maybe you can just copy that particular slide here.
522320	523280	I will do.
523280	526480	This is end to end thing. What I'm saying is if you...
528240	528640	This one?
530400	537680	Go to the last slide, yeah, this one. I just want to see, do we agree with this? Maybe not,
537680	541440	but like does it have the content life cycle steps?
542080	550320	Right, like I think here, like in a way, they have the messaging is not representing
551040	555280	properly here. It was lightly represented here in the last box.
555840	562240	That probably this has more to do than what they are showing here, right?
562880	568800	But maybe in the content space, these three things, the content publishing,
569360	573440	whatever that we are talking about, and then like, what is this model?
573440	575200	Content fragments are generated.
577680	581760	Why the hell do we even talk about Excel files? Like, what the hell are we talking about?
582960	585360	Content fragments are generated automatically.
585360	586640	That is what they do right now.
586640	591040	All right. So content fragments are generated automatically with content
591040	593440	provided in Excel files, bloody hell.
593440	598000	Yeah, that is what they are doing right now. They are trying to...
598000	605600	But what the point is, the first five boxes are how they are planning. This is what
608960	617360	Hong Kong is doing, and maybe they are telling me that like after this, they have,
617920	622080	or in between this, they have PEGA.
623840	629520	PEGA is on the other side here. Yeah, so PEGA will come into when you are deciding
630240	634240	where it goes, because PEGA offers decisioning functionality.
635760	637440	Where do you think it is here?
637440	639760	Here, it is there. Can you see it here?
639760	647680	Yeah, they are pushing it into open banking mobile PEGA.
651200	654880	This doesn't actually even make sense, to be honest, because you need...
656720	659040	I will write up a flow that I think is appropriate.
659920	663360	That is what I want. I think what we need is,
664080	670800	we need an expanded thing, including messaging, including the integration,
671520	678800	including the content pool, and now in the bottom, we can say, hey, we are taking advantage of Adobe,
679440	685360	we are taking advantage of GCP, and maybe we can say, I think even we are taking advantage of
685360	694640	like PEGA, but on the top, the top will be full of the content life, and in the bottom,
694640	704160	the possible platforms that might support it, what I am talking about is a more L-shaped thing.
705600	713920	You can own a vertical, which is the last bit where the delivery will happen, but also you can
713920	720800	do the horizontal content flow. It is, in my opinion, it is more like a, what do you call,
720800	725280	it is not an L, it is an inverted L, like the content flow and...
725280	728320	The T-shaped, like the sort of, yeah.
734640	742240	Okay, so this shows the current workflow on how they raise a request,
743200	749840	how it then gets refilled, so it looks like they do, they fill us in, get sent to GCP,
749840	758960	GCP then creates something in Excel, weird, and then user uploads manually the file to the content
758960	767280	creator, the generator, SMM model, in-app model, content fragments are generated automatically
767360	773360	with content provided in Excel, so this is where, this looks like where it is injecting content
773360	780640	into mobile or into push, but then I don't understand this bit here, how this, what this
780640	785760	is doing, and why content preview and approval is going here, so what is this bit in the middle?
791840	793600	This bit in the middle, what is this?
797280	801280	So it is the Adobe thing, so what they are saying...
801280	806400	That's not Adobe, that's not Adobe, that's not Adobe, it's in Excel, it's in content fragments
806400	813120	are generated automatically with content provided in Excel, so then they get their content ready
813120	818560	and then push it into Adobe? Yeah, so what they are saying, they can take this
819360	827120	small server in or out of Adobe, they're writing, it will take a upload from an Excel
827120	837600	and it is going to turn it into a Adobe fragment, then they will go into Adobe and then like the,
837600	844480	it will enter the proper content for sure, okay, this particular flow, the challenge was
844800	851040	we are asking them to start at number two, they are going into the Adobe and they're trying to
851040	859520	create a new content to be shared with the clients and it was taking way too long, it is taking them
859520	865440	like I think 15 steps, 20 steps, they said oh it is too many steps for us and we are doing way too
865440	873600	many of them, we need our own, we will do whatever way automated, we want API into Adobe, we said
873600	879120	like I think Adobe cannot be opened up to you, then they went in for a, their Excel will give
879120	884800	you an Excel, can you load it into Adobe and turn it into a flow from there, but there is a,
886400	893360	the connection between Adobe and MDP is clear, what they want or we want to see,
894000	898080	the prior to Adobe also we want to streamline,
902240	910800	prior to Adobe also we want to see how we can make it simple and Hong Kong happens to be using
910800	918240	those Jira's and Excel's. So how to simplify this part of the process? As well, yes, yes, yes, yes,
919200	925920	we want to simplify or standardize or make it flexible this part of the process and anyway
925920	933440	we do own the Adobe, we own the MDP, so we want to bring it now. This is the Hong Kong
934240	943280	one particular business use case, Hong Kong digital marketing use case, again we might be having
943280	950880	a different flow for Hong Kong, but ultimately what we want to do is, ultimately what we want
950880	962720	to do is be able to build a consistent content flow for all markets, yes, all use cases, yes,
962720	970320	and I think this is, this is what we are saying here, which is what we would need to do in order
970320	976160	to do that, but the exam question that you sent me on Wednesday night was around replacing or
976160	983440	in-housing AEM and PEGA, so if we are able to retain AEM and PEGA, then the exam question
983440	992480	becomes how do we simplify, is it Hong Kong marketing team self-serving into AEM and pushing
992480	1000640	it three, yes, okay, and they want automated right now, that is what they came to us saying
1000640	1007280	that we were doing whatever we are doing around before, then we are starting this into Adobe,
1007280	1015600	but we want it to be simpler and can we have a better integration, but the point is like
1016320	1024960	what we need to do is we need to own the journeys, we need to understand the various types of
1024960	1032480	content creation, content formatting, content publication journeys, and try to pick the
1032480	1039120	normalized way of doing it and say that L that we are talking about, the distribution,
1039120	1046480	like I think you can think of it as a LRT, sideways T, the thing will come and then
1046480	1053600	like the distribution is vertical, the distribution is vertical, but the content creation and content
1054160	1064160	ideation is horizontal. And just to be clear, are you saying we have to replace AEM and PEGA
1064160	1071600	and in-house it, or we can still leverage PEGA? That is not your problem, that I think
1071600	1085040	what I would say is we need to make this sideways T work with anything that line of business uses
1085040	1092480	for that particular layer, if they happen to use Adobe in UK and in Hong Kong they are using
1092480	1101200	Excel sheet, in IWPG they are using something else for the decision. It should be okay, but we
1101200	1111680	need to provide them with a strategic future state architecture, but to start with, we need to focus
1111680	1120080	on normalizing the journey first, then normalizing the toolkits. Right now first we say this is how
1120160	1125440	everybody is doing it, these are all the life cycle steps, this is what the preferred way,
1125440	1131200	this is where I think people are consistent, this is where people are diverting. So we will start
1131200	1139600	with highlighting the differences for each market, then say most of them are using AEM for content,
1139600	1145440	or some people are using Sitecore, some people have nothing, or maybe coming to this side we say
1145440	1152160	some people are using PEGA, some people are using GCP, some people are not Excel sheets,
1152160	1159360	like we need every life cycle state of the content creation and flow, and even distribution.
1159360	1169840	We need to say, and what I'm saying is, then we say this messaging will work well with this
1169840	1176240	horizontal thing, so that way we want to merge the messaging with this new idea.
1178000	1187440	Okay, all right, got it. But this one is at the way, I think this is not a wasted effort though.
1187440	1193760	Okay. What I'm saying is like, see, PEGA and Adobe in-housing, what we need is,
1194720	1202000	see this is the same thing as we are talking about DSP3, where markets who cannot afford PEGA,
1202960	1209280	we need to give them a simplified solution. Yeah. Where people who cannot afford AEM,
1209280	1215600	we provide with the simpler thing, that I will give it to you as a central thing that we should do,
1215600	1221200	right, but like where, that's why I'm saying it's okay for PEGA and Adobe to be there,
1221840	1228560	anyway, they will be there for next few years. Exactly. But also we can say for a small market
1228560	1236880	Vietnam, how will they do it? Are we able to institutionalize by putting in like some simpler
1237520	1244480	lightweight AEM, lightweight decision? Yeah, yeah, I get you. So let me work on the workflow of
1245360	1251760	the work coming into the content creation, and then how we get that into that sort of
1251760	1255520	distribution element. So like the work coming this way and then the distribution going this way.
1255520	1264080	Let me work on that. As somebody who wants the distribution, because distribution is such a
1265200	1273680	technical non-business thing, we want it to be combined with the business value. Yeah. And
1273680	1280240	we want to have somebody who is doing the distribution to be connected back into the
1280240	1285680	business. I get it. The best way to connect them back to the business is on the journey.
1288320	1292800	Yeah, I get it. And what's the, what's the next steps in this? Because obviously,
1293520	1297120	I can do the thinking on my own, but in order to actually do anything,
1297520	1309120	and we're going to propose to Catherine saying that the new art that we want to create is not
1309120	1314720	just messaging, but it is messaging to us. What is the messaging process? Why is it to make sense
1315280	1322400	for the pieces that we are saying to go along with it? Okay, cool. All right. Thanks,
1322400	1336160	speak soon. See, I'll see you Tuesday in Edinburgh. Bye.
