Leon Ferro is a Senior Mobile Product Designer transitioning into full frontend development, with over 13 years of experience designing end-to-end workflows and complex digital products across multiple industries, with particular expertise in financial services. Based in Berlin, he currently works remotely for CloudLobsters Tech Insurance in London, where he analyses requests, proposes optimal flows with potential edge cases, and then develops fully functional products for claims processing, insurance quotes, and comprehensive dashboards for both B2B SaaS and B2C applications. His role has evolved to include full Svelte 5 frontend development alongside design. For every project, he uses Svelte 5 combined with Tailwind CSS and ShadCN components to create scalable and reusable components which allow him to build faster while maintaining design consistency from concept to deployment.

In his previous experience, at OLX Autos, Leon was the founder designer for their entire Fintech program, initially designed for the Indian market and later expanded across several Asian and Latin American countries, plus Poland, where he designed both the complete merchant loan workflows and in-app interfaces for instalment payments and loan processes for car purchases within the OLX Autos App. This major business expansion resulted in a 30% increase in dealership car buyers. The work involved mapping every step of the customer journey from initial loan application through approval, payment scheduling, and final transaction completion, while creating intuitive user interfaces for each stage. The complexity required understanding credit risk assessment, regulatory compliance for automotive financing across multiple jurisdictions, and creating both seamless user flows and engaging interface designs that could guide customers through what is traditionally a very complex financial process.

Leon also previously led the complete redesign and flow refinement for the checkout process at myToys and Mirapodo (now Otto.de) across the DACH region, handling both mobile app and web experiences. This wasn't just visual design - he mapped the entire customer journey from cart to completion, identifying friction points and enhancing each step of the payment flow, demonstrating how proper workflow design directly impacts business outcomes across diverse markets.

Currently at CloudLobsters, this approach allows him to create functional products that behave exactly as designed, eliminating the typical disconnect between design and development. He maintains design consistency and manageability across different customer implementations, ensuring their insurance products look and feel cohesive regardless of the client's specific branding requirements.

Leon's comprehensive workflow design process cycles through the complete product development lifecycle. He begins with discovery and user research to understand existing processes, conducts stakeholder interviews to identify pain points, creates detailed user journey maps and designs in Figma with interactive components, builds functional products in Svelte 5 to test real user patterns, and takes them through to final deployment. This end-to-end approach ensures that every step of complex processes like insurance claims or loan applications is refined for both user experience and operational efficiency.

He has worked across multiple markets and languages, having designed products for companies in Germany, UK, Austria, Switzerland, and India. Speaking English, Spanish, Italian, and German fluently allows him to conduct user research and collaborate with international teams, understanding cultural nuances that affect financial product adoption and user patterns.

Leon is actively expanding his technical skills, currently improving in JavaScript and TypeScript, and slowly moving into backend development. His educational background includes additional coursework in Computer Science Engineering and Programming, which strengthens his technical foundation. This progression allows him to combine excellent design with functional development, creating more cohesive products where design decisions are informed by technical possibilities and constraints. He works closely with developers throughout the entire process using modern tools like Git and project management systems to ensure consistency between design intentions and final implementation.

He is also integrating AI into his design and development processes to prevent errors and maintain consistency across projects. Additionally, Leon has mentored junior designers at multiple companies, helping them develop both design thinking and technical skills needed for modern product development. At Softgarden, he created effective OKR systems that improved team collaboration and established research methodologies that balanced user needs with business requirements.
