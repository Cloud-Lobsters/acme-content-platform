[00:00.000 --> 00:07.200] okay let's start again the purpose of this is to tell you about my life with

[00:07.200 --> 00:15.160] the view of you creating a mini bio for the purpose persuading HSBC that I'm

[00:15.160 --> 00:19.920] the right candidate for the job okay so I'm gonna give you a run-through and

[00:19.920 --> 00:27.120] then talk about the relevant aspects okay most relevant graduated from

[00:27.120 --> 00:34.360] Imperial College 2006 obtained a master's of science worked in the

[00:34.360 --> 00:40.680] engineering field as an engineer for two years and then moved on to KPMG where

[00:40.680 --> 00:45.160] I became an accountant trained under the ICAEW to become a chartered

[00:45.160 --> 00:48.560] accountant which I am still today working the audit department where I

[00:48.560 --> 00:54.480] audited the biggest banks in London as well as hedge fund HSBC was one of my

[00:54.480 --> 01:00.880] original clients of note in during my tenure as an auditor who was a

[01:00.880 --> 01:07.360] transaction of Visa where Visa Inc bought Visa Simeo and in order to work

[01:07.360 --> 01:11.840] out who should get what you had to figure out how much traffic the members

[01:11.840 --> 01:15.080] of Visa Europe had put through the system over the years in order to

[01:15.080 --> 01:19.560] determine how much of a payout they should get that was my first foray into

[01:19.560 --> 01:26.320] programming proper I used proper well I used VB in order to come up with a

[01:26.320 --> 01:33.520] programmatic way to ascertain and substantiate the valuation which they

[01:33.520 --> 01:37.240] were attributed to their 2,000 odd members which were deemed to receive a

[01:37.240 --> 01:42.240] slice of the action after that I moved on to the modeling team where it was a

[01:42.240 --> 01:47.120] small team when I first joined by the time I left we had 40 50 it's now 200

[01:47.520 --> 01:52.800] 170s it's probably the biggest modeling team in the UK and my job there was

[01:52.800 --> 02:04.280] mostly data modeling writing tactical solutions to help banks get out of a jam

[02:04.280 --> 02:15.080] automate their processes and I would use a combination of VB and SQL and store

[02:15.080 --> 02:21.440] procedures in order to come up with a solution that during that time I became

[02:21.440 --> 02:33.840] more and more technical and in 2015 I jumped ship well actually my time at KPMG

[02:33.840 --> 02:41.000] was marked by the development of a PPI calculator which allowed KPMG to be able

[02:41.160 --> 02:49.240] to figure out how much individual members of the public were owed to were owed as

[02:49.240 --> 02:53.600] a result of having been miss old PPI so the calculation was really difficult and

[02:53.600 --> 03:01.040] we developed an incredibly complex VBA but also Excel and SQL back solution

[03:01.040 --> 03:07.520] that was able to calculate automatically millions upon millions of redressed

[03:07.520 --> 03:15.840] accounts and that was a success we saw that to numerous banks in order to help

[03:15.840 --> 03:22.760] them calculate after that I moved on to become the CTO of a startup called tips

[03:22.760 --> 03:30.000] which works in the FMB sector which was a not a rewards platform but a feedback

[03:30.000 --> 03:38.760] platform for restaurants and other restaurants and establishment opened

[03:38.760 --> 03:45.440] open to the public my job there was to manage a team of developers based in

[03:45.440 --> 03:50.920] Bulgaria and there were four or five of them but also to act as a product owner

[03:50.920 --> 03:59.160] and solution architect in order to guide how the system was going to work so the

[03:59.160 --> 04:06.880] system involved an app it involved a dashboard it involved a client dashboard

[04:06.880 --> 04:13.680] an internal dashboard I didn't write the code for that but I got pretty close to

[04:13.680 --> 04:22.320] it couple of years later the company was struggling so I had to take a job for RBS

[04:22.320 --> 04:27.680] Ulster Bank where they had a remediation program which I essentially rebuilt a

[04:27.680 --> 04:35.360] similar solution that I had done for PPI again using VBA Excel and SQL so a

[04:35.360 --> 04:43.560] tactical solution but then as the work dwindled but they kept me on board

[04:43.560 --> 04:49.560] because I was if they had any requirement for changes it meant that I

[04:49.560 --> 04:55.080] had the opportunity to learn to really delve into programming which I did with

[04:55.800 --> 05:02.080] and use the opportunity to completely rebuild the entire tips platform from

[05:02.080 --> 05:08.920] scratch and solo using no artificial intelligence no AI no framework pure

[05:08.920 --> 05:14.400] JavaScript pure CSS and to do it from the ground up in order to really teach

[05:14.400 --> 05:21.480] myself how programming from first principle worked and that had taken me

[05:21.480 --> 05:27.680] roughly four or five years of intense learning to get the platform to where I

[05:27.680 --> 05:35.760] wanted to be after that time the job at the bank is now coming to an end but I

[05:35.760 --> 05:44.600] had created a new startup in the insurance sector where we essentially

[05:44.600 --> 05:50.920] provide IT services to insurance company and having learned and perfected the

[05:50.920 --> 05:58.040] skills in the last seven years I am now the chief engineer and CTO of cloud

[05:58.040 --> 06:03.240] lobsters and my job is to really hands-on solution architects code and

[06:03.240 --> 06:11.080] deliver solution at a pace rapid pace to our clients I'm we use svelte kit we

[06:11.080 --> 06:18.960] use svelte and svelte kit for front-end back-end but also Node.js and Postgres

[06:19.440 --> 06:26.320] and we deployed to AWS and we we use scripting language the bash language we

[06:26.320 --> 06:33.080] also use a various host of other technologies and services in order to

[06:33.080 --> 06:40.320] rapidly build a solution and we have our own in-house trained LLMs in order to

[06:40.320 --> 06:44.520] assist the the code writing process which is now really quick so we

[06:44.520 --> 06:48.360] leverage other libraries and technologies to really deliver at a

[06:48.360 --> 06:57.240] breakneck speed quality interfaces and solutions for our client in terms of the

[06:57.240 --> 07:06.240] actual key core skills which may be relevant to HSBC in this it would be my

[07:06.240 --> 07:13.440] ability to deliver high value high risk and high and high difficulty projects my

[07:13.480 --> 07:21.040] ability to structure a team for the purpose of achieving the objective that

[07:21.040 --> 07:28.720] they set out to is my deep knowledge of all things IT related including hands-on

[07:28.720 --> 07:33.920] programming which I've been doing daily for the last eight years now my

[07:33.920 --> 07:37.680] understanding of LLMs and how and tell artificial intelligence work we

[07:37.680 --> 07:41.960] incorporate it into our solutions for instance we've done bits where we use AI

[07:41.960 --> 07:49.400] to do on-the-fly translation to any requested language I have also a good eye

[07:49.400 --> 07:54.280] for design I've had being the front-end and back-end designer for all of my

[07:54.280 --> 08:09.760] solutions I can do that and what else I have a good track record a good

[08:09.760 --> 08:14.880] reputation anywhere I go in the industry I've never had to apply for a job never

[08:14.880 --> 08:20.000] had to do a CV in the last 20 years and I tend to once people get me they I

[08:20.000 --> 08:24.440] stick around and I have a very good understanding of finance I'm in charge

[08:24.440 --> 08:29.680] of accounts and I understand how banks work I understand problems that company

[08:29.680 --> 08:34.040] will the banks face and how internal organization are structured and the

[08:34.600 --> 08:40.720] politically navigating that I've also got deep experience in communications and

[08:40.720 --> 08:45.040] messaging in particular because my current startup and the old startup did

[08:45.040 --> 08:49.480] both relied upon communicating directly with the consumer with a consumer so I

[08:49.480 --> 08:58.000] have experience with HTTP the web socket protocol Twilio how to ensure that that

[08:58.200 --> 09:04.360] the content that you is delivered safely monitoring feedback upon what's been

[09:04.360 --> 09:15.480] open what's not dashboarding so on and so forth and that is about it
