[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000] Right, Mr. Heather, start. When did you get involved with computers?

[00:09.000 --> 00:14.000] Uh, I was about 11.

[00:14.000 --> 00:18.000] So you wrote your first computer code at what age?

[00:18.000 --> 00:21.000] Probably 12.

[00:21.000 --> 00:23.000] What was it?

[00:23.000 --> 00:33.000] Um, it was most likely a Python script for auto-translating YAML files for Rust game servers, because I was running game servers at the time on my own server.

[00:33.000 --> 00:36.000] So what does that mean?

[00:36.000 --> 00:39.000] That means that...

[00:39.000 --> 00:43.000] Don't cover your mouth while you speak.

[00:43.000 --> 00:47.000] I really don't know how to describe it.

[00:47.000 --> 00:53.000] You want me to describe what game servers are?

[00:53.000 --> 00:59.000] What was a game server? What were you doing?

[00:59.000 --> 01:01.000] So there is a video game called Rust, which is a PvP massively online game,

[01:01.000 --> 01:07.000] and I created a community server for it, which had a lot of modifications to the core functionality of the game.

[01:07.000 --> 01:15.000] How many people used it?

[01:15.000 --> 01:17.000] I had a peak players at around 12 people at once.

[01:17.000 --> 01:22.000] What was your next project?

[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000] Apart from that. My next project was Atlas servers, which was essentially AWS,

[01:25.000 --> 01:35.000] a replica of AWS using Docker containers to deploy game servers programmatically.

[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000] Okay, I understand why you went from one to the other. What was the purpose of that?

[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000] Well, I was already using an existing solution for that called Teradactyl,

[01:47.000 --> 01:54.000] but I felt like it wasn't as useful as it could be, so I just decided to replicate it

[01:54.000 --> 02:01.000] using a lot of advanced bleeding edge technology such as gRPC, Protobufs, Golang.

[02:01.000 --> 02:08.000] It was a whole microservices architecture.

[02:08.000 --> 02:10.000] What did you learn?

[02:10.000 --> 02:12.000] I learned how to scale applications and how to deploy them across nodes

[02:12.000 --> 02:17.000] and keep communications between them very efficiently as well using gRPC.

[02:17.000 --> 02:22.000] When you first started, did you think it was going to be easy, hard, and how did it turn out to be?

[02:22.000 --> 02:29.000] I thought it would be difficult, and it was difficult.

[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000] What happened to the project in the end?

[02:34.000 --> 02:37.000] Well, I got to about 90% there, but due to certain life events, I stopped working on it.

[02:37.000 --> 02:44.000] How long did you work on it?

[02:44.000 --> 02:46.000] Well, it had gone through many stages. I was working on it for about three years,

[02:46.000 --> 02:52.000] but only a year and a bit was actually spent doing that VM logic.

[02:52.000 --> 02:58.000] What technologies did you use to build it?

[02:58.000 --> 03:00.000] I used Golang, Next.js, Fluentd, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ, Prometheus for monitoring, and Kubernetes.

[03:00.000 --> 03:23.000] After that, what did you do? How old were you when you started and when you finished that project?

[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000] I believe I was 13 when I started developing on it, but when I was 14, 15,

[03:27.000 --> 03:35.000] that's when I truly started doing the proper scaling part of it, so the whole integration with Docker.

[03:35.000 --> 03:42.000] So nothing, it never went into production in the end?

[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000] It never went into production, no.

[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000] But you learned a lot of things.

[03:46.000 --> 03:47.000] Exactly.

[03:47.000 --> 03:48.000] After that, what was your next project?

[03:48.000 --> 03:50.000] Major project? I created an AI image generator, which I locally hosted all of the model weights.

[03:50.000 --> 03:58.000] I set up a whole microservices architecture with upwards of around 12 different repositories,

[03:58.000 --> 04:07.000] all interconnected, providing a lot of features such as social media,

[04:07.000 --> 04:13.000] a whole feed with a recommendation algorithm attached to it, authentication systems.

[04:13.000 --> 04:19.000] Was that before ChatGPT?

[04:19.000 --> 04:25.000] No, no.

[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000] That was after ChatGPT when LLMs?

[04:27.000 --> 04:28.000] Yeah, this was three years ago.

[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000] Three years ago. Okay, and what happened to that project?

[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000] Well, it failed on the marketing side due to a lack of runway.

[04:33.000 --> 04:35.000] So you managed to put it into production this time?

[04:35.000 --> 04:39.000] Yes, this was put into production. I ran an entire marketing campaign against it.

[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000] And how old were you when you started and finished that?

[04:40.000 --> 04:44.000] I believe 16 when I started, 17 when I ended, 17, 18.

[04:44.000 --> 04:46.000] And then after that, what was your next project?

[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000] Well, then I started working at a company called TIPS.

[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000] What did you do there?

[04:54.000 --> 05:00.000] I co-developed a new version for the analytics system to show off all the...

[05:00.000 --> 05:03.000] What technologies did you use?

[05:03.000 --> 05:06.000] I used FeltKit.

[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000] And what was the language that was used for FeltKit?

[05:08.000 --> 05:09.000] JavaScript, as well as TypeScript.

[05:09.000 --> 05:19.000] TypeScript. And so you perfected your front-end design and back-end skills?

[05:19.000 --> 05:21.000] Exactly.

[05:21.000 --> 05:22.000] Okay. And what other technologies was used in TIPS?

[05:22.000 --> 05:24.000] SQL.

[05:24.000 --> 05:27.000] As well as for messaging?

[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000] Twilio.

[05:30.000 --> 05:38.000] Twilio and Sangred.

[05:38.000 --> 05:39.000] And Sangred. So we got experience to communicate with a large number of people and to do it safely.

[05:39.000 --> 05:40.000] Yes, exactly.

[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000] What other skills did you learn outside of IT working in the real world for the first time?

[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000] Your other projects where you solo?

[05:48.000 --> 05:49.000] I was solo on every single project I've done up until TIPS.

[05:49.000 --> 05:51.000] So you learned to start to work with...

[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000] A team.

[05:54.000 --> 05:55.000] A team of people. You understood, you got exposure to...

[05:55.000 --> 05:57.000] The working environment of the real world, real-world deadlines.

[05:57.000 --> 06:03.000] Yes, it was.

[06:03.000 --> 06:04.000] Yes, exactly.

[06:04.000 --> 06:05.000] So you learned to work with...

[06:05.000 --> 06:06.000] A team.

[06:06.000 --> 06:12.000] got exposure to the working environment of the real world, real world deadlines

[06:12.000 --> 06:14.000] and planning and also how mission-critical system work yes because we

[06:14.000 --> 06:17.000] constantly had to respond to emergencies as well as an introduction to the

[06:17.000 --> 06:19.000] business world in terms of how businesses work yeah and okay and then after that

[06:19.000 --> 06:20.000] and after that I joined up with the CEO of tips and the CEO to move on to a new

[06:20.000 --> 06:24.000] project a new startup called cloud lobsters where I managed the AWS

[06:24.000 --> 06:30.000] infrastructure I built a large portion of the back-end system that manages all

[06:30.000 --> 06:31.000] of the insurance lifecycle or the policy lifecycle I also helped build the

[06:31.000 --> 06:32.000] templating engine to send out emails and allowing to programmatically generate

[06:32.000 --> 06:33.000] templates for emails as well as payment integration within the API and the

[06:33.000 --> 06:34.000] insurance forms that we managed and how many projects roughly have you stood up

[06:34.000 --> 06:35.000] during cloud lobsters yeah I set up approximately seven in a space of six

[06:35.000 --> 06:36.000] months okay so a multitude of platforms a multitude of experience okay and you

[06:36.000 --> 06:37.000] come from a programming stock your father having worked at HSBC in the

[06:37.000 --> 06:42.200] finance sector or in the finance sector in general he worked in a fintech company

[06:42.200 --> 06:54.520] well he started a company that built systems financial systems for traders

[06:54.520 --> 07:03.000] called Martini which he later sold to a company called Sun Guard which

[07:03.000 --> 07:13.120] distributed it to a large number of different banking different banking

[07:13.120 --> 07:23.440] institutions a huge volume mission critical forming the backbone of trading

[07:23.440 --> 07:29.680] systems for financial institutions so you always had exposure to that world

[07:29.680 --> 07:34.920] and you understand it yes I mean my father he has helped me along my

[07:34.920 --> 07:42.000] journey as in he provided me with a server to mess around with when I was

[07:42.000 --> 07:47.600] 11 I managed to set up entire Windows server systems on it mailbox integration

[07:47.600 --> 07:54.800] I set up an entire yes an entire mailbox and what do you want to further skills

[07:54.800 --> 07:59.480] you want to develop and work on in the IT and business side on to better

[08:00.280 --> 08:09.720] understand on how to work in a large team and be able to communicate properly

[08:09.720 --> 08:16.720] with my co-workers well and in terms of like technology I would also like to

[08:16.720 --> 08:24.120] better on my understanding of LLMs even though I come from a vast experience of

[08:24.120 --> 08:29.040] working with LLMs since I have been using chat GBT since GPT-2 came out and

[08:29.600 --> 08:36.120] deploy them in for business critical functions and deploy them to the to try

[08:36.120 --> 08:42.040] and innovate inside of mission critical and large systems which this opportunity

[08:42.040 --> 08:45.640] is going to afford us exactly okay thank you very much

[08:45.640 --> 08:52.160] 

[08:52.160 --> 08:56.600] 

[08:56.600 --> 09:02.480] 

[09:02.480 --> 09:07.440] 

[09:07.440 --> 09:13.960] 

[09:13.960 --> 09:19.720] 

[09:19.720 --> 09:26.040] 

[09:26.080 --> 09:31.240] 

[09:31.240 --> 09:44.120] 

[09:44.120 --> 09:48.480] 

[09:48.480 --> 09:54.920] 

[09:54.960 --> 10:01.640] 

[10:01.640 --> 10:08.720] 

[10:08.720 --> 10:15.160]
